This species has received great attention regarding several aspects of physiology as well as an organism to study the impact of environmental contaminations. However, experiments using validated and objective tests to evaluate the jundiÃ¡ behavior are scarce. The effects of acute stress have been studied in other fish species, such as zebrafish (Danio rerio), however, the effects in jundiÃ¡ are lacking. Thus, we evaluated the effects of acute stress (net chasing) on anxiety-like and social behavior in jundiÃ¡. For these purpose, all behavioral analyses were carried out using automated tracking software. We showed that the acute stress protocol increased cortisol levels and induced anxiogenic-like behavior in the novel tank test, and decreased social behavior in jundiÃ¡. The antidepressant fluoxetine was able to prevent the effects of acute stress on social behavior. Here we show a behavioral evaluation of Rhamdia quelen using consolidated tests and computerized analysis, which allows more measurable, reliable and comparable results. Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc."

Olfactory deficits can be induced in fish experimentally, and utilized to examine the role of olfaction in their normal and pathological behaviors. Here, we examine whether experimental anosmia, evoked by ZnSO4 in adult zebrafish can be associated with behavioral and/or physiological responses. We show that experimental ZnSO4-induced anosmia caused acute, but not prolonged, anxiogenic-like effects on zebrafish behavior tested in the novel tank test. The procedure also elevated whole-body cortisol levels in zebrafish. Moreover, ZnSO4 treatment, but not sham, produced damage to olfactory epithelium, inducing overt basal cell vacuolization and intercellular edema. The loss of olfaction, assessed by the fish food preference behavior in the aquatic Y-maze, was present 1 h, but not 24 h, after the treatment. Collectively, this suggests that transient experimental anosmia by ZnSO4 modulates zebrafish behavior and olfaction, which can be used to evoke and assess their stress-related anxiety-like states.

"Aponte, A. and Petrunich-Rutherford, M.L.",Acute net stress of young adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) is not sufficient to increase anxiety-like behavior and whole-body cortisol,2019,PeerJ,2019,8,,"In recent years, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become a popular model to study the mechanisms of physiological and behavioral effects of stress, due to the similarity in neural structures and biochemical pathways between zebrafish and mammals. Previous research in this vertebrate animal model has demonstrated an increase in whole-body cortisol resulting from an acute (30-second) net handling stress, but it remains unclear whether such a stressor will concomitantly increase anxiety-like behavior. In addition, as the previous study examined the effects of this acute stressor in adult zebrafish after a brief period of isolation, it is unclear whether this stressor would be effective in eliciting cortisol increases in younger aged subjects without isolation. In the current study, young adult zebrafish (approximately 90 days post-fertilization) were briefly exposed to a net handling stressor and were subsequently subjected to either the novel tank test or the light/dark preference test. The novel tank test was used to measure exploration and habituation in response to a novel environment, and the light/dark preference test was used to measure locomotor activity and scototaxis behavior. All subjects were sacrificed 15 minutes post-stressor and were analyzed for whole-body levels of cortisol. Contrary to expectations, there was no effect of acute net handling on cortisol levels. Similarly, acute net handling did not significantly induce anxiety-like behavior during the novel tank test or the light/dark preference test. Our findings demonstrate that there are possible developmental differences in response to an acute net handling stress, as we did not observe alterations in hormonal or behavioral measures of anxiety in young adult zebrafish. Alternatively, if zebrafish are not isolated before the stressor, they may be more resilient to a brief acute stressor. These results suggest the need for a different or more intense acute stressor in order further explore neuroendocrine mechanisms and anxiety-like behavior at this developmental stage in the zebrafish animal model.

It ensures housing of laboratory animals in environments with space and complexity that enable the expression of their normal behavioral repertoire. Auditory enrichment by exposure to classical music decreases abnormal behaviors and endocrine stress responses in humans, non-humans primates, and rodents. However, little is known about the role of auditory enrichment in laboratory zebrafish. Given the growing importance of zebrafish for neuroscience research, such studies become critical. To examine whether auditory enrichment by classical music can affect fish behavior and physiology, we exposed adult zebrafish to 2 h of Vivaldi's music (65-75 dB) twice daily, for 15 days. Overall, zebrafish exposed to such auditory stimuli were less anxious in the novel tank test and less active, calmer in the light-dark test, also affecting zebrafish physiological (immune) biomarkers, decreasing peripheral levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing the activity of some CNS genes, without overt effects on whole-body cortisol levels. In summary, we report that twice-daily exposure to continuous musical sounds may provide benefits over the ongoing 50-55 dB background noise of equipment in the laboratory setting. Overall, our results support utilizing auditory enrichment in laboratory zebrafish to reduce stress and improve welfare in this experimental aquatic organism. Â© 2018 Barcellos et al."
"Blaser, R.E. and Rosemberg, D.B.",Measures of anxiety in zebrafish (Danio rerio): Dissociation of black/white preference and novel tank test,2012,PLoS ONE,7,5,,"The effects of wall color stimuli on diving, and the effects of depth stimuli on scototaxis, were assessed in zebrafish. Three groups of fish were confined to a black, a white, or a transparent tank, and tested for depth preference. Two groups of fish were confined to a deep or a shallow tank, and tested for black-white preference. As predicted, fish preferred the deep half of a split-tank over the shallow half, and preferred the black half of a black/white tank over the white half. Results indicated that the tank wall color significantly affected depth preference, with the transparent tank producing the strongest depth preference and the black tank producing the weakest preference. Tank depth, however, did not significantly affect color preference. Additionally, wall color significantly affected shuttling and immobility, while depth significantly affected shuttling and thigmotaxis. These results are consistent with previous indications that the diving response and scototaxis may reflect dissociable mechanisms of behavior. We conclude that the two tests are complementary rather than interchangeable, and that further research on the motivational systems underlying behavior in each of the two tests is needed.

In this protocol, we describe a battery of two assays to characterize anxiety-related behavioral and endocrine phenotypes in adult zebrafish. Here, we detail how to use the 'novel tank' test to assess behavioral indices of anxiety (including reduced exploration, increased freezing behavior and erratic movement), which are quantifiable using manual registration and computer-aided video-tracking analyses. In addition, we describe how to analyze whole-body zebrafish cortisol concentrations that correspond to their behavior in the novel tank test. This protocol is an easy, inexpensive and effective alternative to other methods of measuring stress responses in zebrafish, thus enabling the rapid acquisition and analysis of large amounts of data. As will be shown here, fish anxiety-like behavior can be either attenuated or exaggerated depending on stress or drug exposure, with cortisol levels generally expected to parallel anxiety behaviors. This protocol can be completed over the course of 2 d, with a variable testing duration depending on the number of fish used. Â© 2010 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved."

Most of the studies on anxiety and related mood disorders are performed in rodents, and a good model is chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). In this study, we have attempted to understand the molecular basis of the neuroglial and behavioral changes underlying CUS-induced mood disorders in the simplest vertebrate model, the zebrafish, Danio rerio. Zebrafish were subjected to a CUS paradigm in which two different stressors were used daily for 15 days, and thorough behavioral analyses were performed to assess anxiety and related mood disorder phenotypes using the novel tank test, shoal cohesion and scototaxis. Fifteen days of exposure to chronic stressors appears to induce an anxiety and related mood disorder phenotype. Decreased neurogenesis, another hallmark of anxiety and related disorders in rodents, was also observed in this zebrafish model. The common molecular markers of rodent anxiety and related disorders, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), calcineurin (ppp3r1a) and phospho cyclic AMP response element binding protein (pCREB), were also replicated in the fish model. Finally, using 2DE FTMS/ITMSMS proteomics analyses, 18 proteins were found to be deregulated in zebrafish anxiety and related disorders. The most affected process was mitochondrial function, 4 of the 18 differentially regulated proteins were mitochondrial proteins: PHB2, SLC25A5, VDAC3 and IDH2, as reported in rodent and clinical samples. Thus, the zebrafish CUS model and proteomics can facilitate not only uncovering new molecular targets of anxiety and related mood disorders but also the routine screening of compounds for drug development.

Therefore, we compared gradual cooling, lidocaine hydrochloride (300, 325, and 350 mg/L), metomidate hydrochloride (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mg/L), and isoflurane (0.5 mL/L) MS222 (150 mg/L) for anesthesia of adult zebrafish. The efficacy and safety of each agent was evaluated by observing loss equilibrium, slowing of opercular movement, response to tail-fin pinch, recovery time, and anesthesia-associated mortality rates. At 15 min after anesthetic recovery, we used a novel-tank test to evaluate whether anesthetic exposure influenced term anxiety-like behavior. Behavioral parameters measured included latency to enter and number of transitions to the half of the tank, number of erratic movements, and number of freezing bouts. Behavior after anesthesia was unaltered of the anesthetic used. Efficacy and safety differed among the anesthetics evaluated. Gradual cooling was useful short procedures requiring immobilization only, but all instrumentation and surfaces that come in contact with fish must maintained at approximately 10Â°C. MS222 and lidocaine hydrochloride at 325 mg/L were effective as anesthetic agents for procedures in adult zebrafish, but isoflurane and high-dose lidocaine hydrochloride were unsuitable as sole anesthetic due to high (30%) mortality rates. Although MS222 remains the best choice for generating a surgical plane of anesthesia, metomidate hydrochloride and gradual cooling were useful for sedation and immobilization for nonpainful procedures.

Although the use of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate both behavioral and physiological nociception-related responses is expanding rapidly, the characterization of behavioral phenotypes that reflect injury location is limited, making the results of such studies difficult to interpret. Here, we characterize putative nociception-related behavioral phenotypes in adult zebrafish following an intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of acetic acid, a well-established protocol for visceral pain in rodents. Acetic acid (2.5 and 5.0%) induced an abdominal constriction-like response, which was assessed by measuring a body curvature index. Moreover, all doses tested (0.5â€“5.0%) reduced distance traveled and vertical activity in the novel tank test. Freezing duration increased following 5.0% acetic acid, whereas fish injected with 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0% spent more time in top area of the tank. Both morphine (an opioid analgesic) and diclofenac (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, NSAID) prevented the 5.0% acetic acid-induced changes in body curvature index, whereas naloxone blocked these effects of morphine. Overall, zebrafish exposed to a single acetic acid i.p. injection display abnormal body curvature and specific changes in behavioral parameters sensitive to anti-nociceptive pharmacological modulation. We suggest that the abdominal constriction-like response represents a novel specific nociceptive-related phenotype in zebrafish. In general, our findings support the growing utility of zebrafish in translational pain research and antinociceptive drug discovery. Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V."

Zebrafish have been used as models to study neurobehavioral effects of ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal, but the mechanisms associated with these effects are not yet clear. Adult zebrafish were treated with 1% EtOH for 20 min per day for 8 days, injected with the nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS-2) inhibitor aminoguanidine (50 mg/kg), and allowed to experience withdrawal (WD) in their hometanks for 7 days. EtOH WD increased anxiety-like behavior in the novel tank test, an effect that was blocked by aminoguanidine. EtOH WD also increased brain levels of nitrite, an effect that was partially blocked by aminoguanidine. These results underline a novel mechanism by which NOS-2 controls anxiety-like responses to ethanol withdrawal, with implications for the mechanistic study of symptoms associated with chronic ethanol abuse.

With regard to the time elapsed between feeding and behavioral evaluation, fish fed 3 h before behavioral evaluation in the novel tank test (NTT) showed decreased activity and a trend toward an anxiolytic reaction (increased use of the upper section of the aquarium) in comparison to fish fed 0.5, 6, 12, 24 or 48 h before testing, although differences were not statistically significant for all comparisons. Activity and use of the upper section of the aquarium did not differ significantly among the other treatments. Regarding feeding frequency, fish fed once a day showed higher anxiety-like behavior (decreased use of the upper section of the aquarium) in comparison to fish fed twice a day, but feeding four or six times per day or only every second day did not result in differences from feeding twice a day. Feeding frequency had no effect on activity level. Metabolically, fish fed once a day presented decreased levels of glucose and glycogen and increased lactate when compared to the regular feeding (fish fed twice a day), suggesting that feeding regimen may modulate carbohydrate metabolism. Mechanistically, we suggest that the metabolic changes caused by the feeding regimen may induce behavioral changes. Our results suggest that the high variability of the results among different laboratories might be related to different feeding protocols. Therefore, if issues pertaining to the feeding regimen are not considered during experiments with zebrafish, erroneous interpretations of datasets may occur. Â© 2018 Dametto et al."

Lidocaine also has central action, affecting behavior both clinically and in animal models. Adult zebrafish are rapidly becoming a critical novel model organism in translational neuroscience research. Here, we examine the effects of acute peripheral (lateral line application, 4%) and systemic (water immersion, 1, 5 and 10 mg/L) administration of lidocaine on adult zebrafish behavior tested in the novel tank test. Overall, the drug evoked hypolocomotor effect when applied systemically (at 10 mg/L) and peripherally. Peripheral lidocaine also reduced top exploration in the novel tank test (vs. sham), suggesting anxiogenic-like effect of the lateral line blockage, Our findings show the importance of the lateral line system in driving adult zebrafish locomotion, and suggest sedative-like effects of systemic lidocaine in aduld zebrafish. In addition, reflecting the role of central cholinergic contribution in lidocaine action, brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was lower following peripheral and systemic administration of lidocaine at behaviorally active doses. Collectively, our data support the effects of lidocaine on behavioral responses in zebrafish, and reinforce the growing utility of this aquatic model to screen various CNS drugs.

"DePasquale, C. and Leri, J.",The influence of exercise on anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish (Danio rerio),2018,Behavioural Processes,157,,638-644,"In non-human mammals, exercise has been shown to decrease anxiety-like behavior. Conversely, a number of studies have reported no effect or even an increase in anxiety-like behavior after exercise, however, inconsistent training regimes and behavioral paradigms across studies may be confounding the results. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are a well-established animal model in neurobehavioral research, and have the potential to shed new insight into the effects of exercise on anxiety-like behavior where previous research has been limited, due to the ability to precisely control intensity and duration of exercise, and the validation of tests for measuring different aspects of anxiety-like behaviors. In the current study, fish were split between two treatment groups; Exercised and Control. Fish in the exercised condition were aerobically challenged (max water velocity: 0.5 m/s) using a swim tunnel one hour a day, five days a week, for six weeks. Control fish spent an equal amount of time in the swim tunnel but were not aerobically challenged (max water velocity: 0.05 m/s). After six weeks, all fish were tested individually in two standard complimentary anxiety tests for zebrafish: the novel tank test and the light-dark test. Exercised fish exhibited reduced anxiety-like behaviors in the novel tank test; they spent more time in the top and were quicker to enter the top of a novel tank compared to Control fish. In addition, Exercised fish spent more time in the light compartment of the light-dark test compared to Control fish. Our results demonstrate the beneficial effect of exercise on anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish. Â© 2018 The Authors"

The use of conspecific alarm substance (CAS) for inducing anxiety-like behaviors in fish species provides important translational insights of how aversive conditions modulate neurobehavioral functions. Because nicotine may elicit anxiolytic-like responses, here we investigated whether acute nicotine exposure prevents CAS-induced anxiogenic-like behaviors in zebrafish. We used both novel tank and light-dark tests as two well-established paradigms for measuring anxiety-like phenotypes. Fish were individually exposed to 1 mg/L nicotine or non-chlorinated water for 3 min and then transferred to other tanks in the absence or presence of 3.5 mL/L CAS for 5 min. Later, the behavior of fish was tested in the novel tank test or in the light-dark preference test. As expected, CAS triggered aversive behaviors by increasing bottom-dwelling, freezing, erratic movements, scototaxis, and risk assessment episodes. Nicotine alone elicited anxiolytic-like behaviors since it increased the time spent in the top, as well as the average duration of entry in the lit compartment. Moreover, nicotine pretreatment prevented CAS-induced aversive responses without changing locomotion, suggesting that anxiolysis could play a role, at least in part, to the behavioral effects of nicotine observed here. Overall, these novel findings show the beneficial effects of nicotine on anxiogenic responses in zebrafish. We also reinforce the practical advantages of this aquatic species to explore the relieving properties of nicotine, as well as to understand the neurobiological bases involved in anxiety-related disorders and associated therapeutic targets.

Functional ingredients in diets may substantially impact the physiology and stress responses of host organisms. Here, we hypothesized that the administration of a dietary prebiotic might attenuate the negative influences of feed deprivation on the behavioral profile of anxiety and physiological responses to stress in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Fish were fed with either basal or mannan-oligosaccharide supplemented (0.4% MOS/kg diet) diets, once per day (normal-control: CN, and normal-prebiotic: PN) or once every other day (starved-control: CS, and starved-prebiotic: PS) for 8 weeks. Afterwards, fish were subjected to a novel tank test to measure anxiety. Fish from the CS treatment exhibited more pronounced bottom-dwelling behavior than the other treatments. The number of transitions from the bottom to the top third of the novel tank was significantly higher in PN fish than the CS specimens. No significant differences were found between the CN and PS treatments in all of the anxiety behaviors. CS fish showed higher baseline cortisol levels than the other treatments, which was in line with higher expression of CRH gene in fish subjected to this treatment. Cortisol levels and CRH gene expression of the subjects were also measured after induction of two routine aquaculture stressors. CN and PS fish exhibited similar patterns of cortisol responses at most of the sampling times after stress, and PN specimens showed a significantly lower concentration of cortisol than the other treatments in most cases. Expression of the CRH gene was higher in feed deprived fish immediately after stress induction. Overall, the results show that feed deprivation in some cases influenced anxiety-like behaviors and elevated stress response in zebrafish juveniles; however, the addition of MOS to the diet helped deprived fish exhibit behaviors more typical of normally fed animals.

Zebrafish has been widely used to study neuropharmacology and has become a promising animal model to investigate neurobehavioral mechanisms of stress. In this report the animals were submitted to acute restraint stress for different time lengths (15, 60 and 90. min) for further evaluation of behavioral patterns, whole-body cortisol content, and corticotropin-releasing hormone expression. The results demonstrated an increase in the locomotor activity and an alteration in the swimming pattern during a 5-min trial after the acute restraint stress. Interestingly, all groups of fish tested in the novel tank test exhibited signs of anxiety as evaluated by the time spent in the bottom of the tank. Whole-body cortisol content showed a positive correlation with increased behavioral indices of locomotion in zebrafish whereas molecular analysis of corticotropin-releasing hormone showed a late reduction of mRNA expression (90. min). Altogether, we present a model of acute restraint stress in zebrafish, confirmed by elevated cortisol content, as a valid and reliable model to study the biochemical basis of stress behavior, which seems to be accompanied by a negative feedback of corticotropin-release hormone mRNA expression.

It has been reported that caffeine possesses a protective effect in neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, this study investigates the potential of caffeine to protect brain functions from adverse effects due to stress exposure during early-life development in the male zebrafish. In the first part of this study, synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (DEX) (2-200. mg/L for 24. h) was used to induce stress effects in the zebrafish larvae from 4 to 5. days post-fertilisation (dpf) and the effect of DEX administration on zebrafish larvae on anxiety-like behaviour during adulthood in novel tank test was investigated. Next, the possible protective effect of caffeine pre-treatment (5-50. mg/L for 24. h from 3 to 4. dpf) before DEX administration was studied. DEX-treated adult male zebrafish showed higher anxiety levels in behavioural tests, as seen in longer latency to enter the top part of the tank, lower transition numbers between the top and bottom parts with more time spent at the bottom and lesser time spent at the top and lower distance travelled at top part. The effect of DEX on anxiety-like behaviour was dose-dependent. Importantly, adult male zebrafish pre-treated with caffeine before DEX treatment did not show any anxiety-like behaviour.

Using carbamazepine (CBZ) as a test drug, we employed dried blood spot (DBS) cards to enable drug quantification for PK; and we evaluated the pharmacological anxiolytic effect using novel tank test. Results: The PK study confirmed the presence of CBZ in both blood and brain and the behavioural study showed dose dependent anxiolytic effect. The reproducibility of oral dosing was confirmed by the fact that the results obtained in both the experiments had negligible errors.

Reserpine depletes monoamines, and causes depression and hypoactivity in humans and rodents. In contrast, d-amphetamine increases brain monoamines' levels, and evokes hyperactivity and anxiety. However, the effects of these agents on behavior and in relation to monoamine levels remain poorly understood, necessitating further experimental studies to understand their psychotropic action. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly emerging as a promising model organism for drug screening and translational neuroscience research. Here, we have examined the acute and long-term effects of reserpine and d-amphetamine on zebrafish behavior in the novel tank test. Overall, d-amphetamine (5 and 10 mg/L) evokes anxiogenic-like effects in zebrafish acutely, but not 7 days later. In contrast, reserpine (20 and 40 mg/L) did not evoke overt acute behavioral effects, but markedly reduced activity 7 days later, resembling motor retardation observed in depression and/or Parkinson's disease. Three-dimensional 'temporal' (X, Y, time) reconstructions of zebrafish locomotion further supports these findings, confirming the utility of 3D-based video-tracking analyses in zebrafish models of drug action. Our results show that zebrafish are highly sensitive to drugs bi-directionally modulating brain monoamines, generally paralleling rodent and clinical findings. Collectively, this emphasizes the potential of zebrafish tests to model complex brain disorders associated with monoamine dysregulation. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Here, we examine the effects of mescaline (5-20. mg/l) and PCP (0.5-3. mg/l) in several zebrafish paradigms, including the novel tank, open field and shoaling tests. Mescaline and PCP dose-dependently increased top activity in the novel tank test, also reducing immobility and disrupting the patterning of zebrafish swimming, as assessed by ethograms. PCP, but not mescaline, evoked circling behavior in the open field test. At the highest doses tested, mescaline markedly increased, while PCP did not affect, zebrafish shoaling behavior. Finally, 20. mg/l mescaline did not alter, and 3. mg/l PCP elevated, whole-body cortisol levels.

However, it is based upon the ability of animal models, such as the zebrafish, to demonstrate predictive validity for a specific set of drug classes. A popular assay used for this purpose is the novel tank diving paradigm, where zebrafish behavior can easily be modulated by anxiolytic or anxiogenic drug exposure. However, predictive validity may fail to provide crucial information about the model, such as comparisons of drug efficacy and the effects of drugs on varying behavioral phenotypes. This deficit is accounted for by a novel measure termed the Maximum Predictive Value (MPV), which provides an estimate of how sensitive a particular model is when assessing its potential pharmacologically. Here we provide a protocol detailing how to employ this measure to validate behavioral endpoints in the novel tank test for use in pharmacological studies in zebrafish.

Behavioral abnormalities have been addressed in CHARGE syndrome, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we performed four behavioral testsâ€”including the open-field test, novel-tank test, shoaling test and mirror-induced attack testâ€”in chd7 heterozygous zebrafish mutants in order to characterize the behavioral abnormalities in a zebrafish model of CHARGE syndrome. We found that chd7 heterozygous mutants exhibited anxious-like behavior and aggressive-like behavior in the open-field test and in the mirror-induced attack test, respectively, which resembled the reported behavioral abnormalities in CHARGE syndrome in humans. Moreover, we found that glycine and D-cycloserine treatment rescued the aggressive behavior of chd7 heterozygous zebrafish mutants, indicating that the excitation and inhibition balance might be disrupted in the brains of chd7 heterozygous zebrafish mutants. Further analysis showed that the expression of glycine transporters was dramatically increased in the brains of chd7 heterozygous zebrafish mutants. Treatment with an inhibitor of glycine transporter 1, sarcosine, partially rescued the aggressive-like behavior of chd7 heterozygous zebrafish mutants. Taken together, our data suggest that the aggressive behavior in CHARGE syndrome may be due to the increased expression of glycine transporters, and inhibition of the activity of glycine transporters may be an approach to treat the behavioral abnormalities in CHARGE syndrome.

Different models of unpredictable chronic stress (UCS) have been established in rodents; however, these protocols are expensive, long-lasting, and require a large physical structure. Our group has recently reported an UCS protocol in zebrafish with several advantages compared to rodent models. We observed that UCS induced behavioral, biochemical, and molecular changes similar to those observed in depressed patients, supporting the translational relevance of the protocol. Objectives: Considering that a pharmacological assessment is lacking in this zebrafish model, our aim was to evaluate the effects of anxiolytic (bromazepam) and antidepressant drugs (fluoxetine and nortriptyline) on behavioral (novel tank test), biochemical (whole-body cortisol), and molecular parameters (cox-2, tnf-Î±, il-6, and il-10 gene expression) in zebrafish subjected to UCS. Results: We replicated previous data showing that UCS induces behavioral and neuroendocrine alterations in zebrafish, and we show for the first time that anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs are able to prevent such effects. Furthermore, we extended the molecular characterization of the model, revealing that UCS increases expression of the pro-inflammatory markers cox-2 and il-6, which was also prevented by the drugs tested. Conclusions: This study reinforces the use of zebrafish as a model organism to study the behavioral and physiological effects of stress. The UCS protocol may also serve as a screening tool for evaluating new drugs that can be used to treat psychiatric disorders with stress-related etiologies.

Environmental enrichment (EE) is one such manipulation that promotes neuroprotection and neurogenesis, besides affecting behaviors such as drug self-administration. Zebrafish are a popular and useful animal model for behavioral neuroscience studies; however, studies evaluating the impact of housing conditions in this species are scarce. In this study, we verified the effects of EE on behavioral (novel tank test) and biochemical [cortisol and reactive oxygen species (ROS)] parameters in zebrafish submitted to unpredictable chronic stress (UCS). Consistent with our previous findings, UCS increased anxiety-like behavior, cortisol and ROS levels in zebrafish. EE for 21 or 28 days attenuated the effects induced by UCS on behavior and cortisol, and prevented the effects on ROS levels. Our findings reinforce the idea that EE exerts neuromodulatory effects across species, reducing vulnerability to stress and its biochemical impact. Also, these results indicate that zebrafish is a suitable model animal to study the behavioral effects and neurobiological mechanisms related to EE. Â© 2018.

Recently, behavioral tests for anxiety have been proposed in zebrafish. Exposure to the novel tank test or to the light/dark test increased extracellular fluid 5-HT content in the brain; anxiety-like behavior correlated positively with 5-HT content in the novel tank test, while the correlation was negative in the light/dark test. Acute treatment with a low dose of fluoxetine was anxiolytic in the geotaxis test and anxiogenic in the scototaxis test, while treatment with a higher dose produced a hyperlocomotor effect in both tasks. Buspirone and WAY 100635 were anxiolytic in both tests, while SB 224289 was anxiolytic in the geotaxis and slightly anxiogenic in the scototaxis test. Serotonin depletion with pCPA was anxiogenic in the geotaxis and anxiolytic in scototaxis. These results underline the differential sensitivity of these tasks to assess serotonergic agents; alternatively, serotonin might regulate zebrafish behavior differently in the novel tank test and in the light/dark test.

The exact CNS action of TCAs remains poorly understood, necessitating new screening approaches and novel model organisms. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly emerging as a promising tool for pharmacological research of antidepressants, including amitriptyline. Here, we examine the effects of chronic 2-week exposure to 10 and 50 Î¼g/L amitriptyline on zebrafish behavior and monoamine neurotransmitters. Overall, the drug at 50 Î¼g/L evoked pronounced anxiolytic-like effects in the novel tank test (assessed by more time in top, fewer transition and shorter latency to enter the top). Like other TCAs, amitriptyline reduced serotonin turnover, but also significantly elevated whole-brain norepinephrine and dopamine levels. The latter effect was not reported in this model previously, and accompanied higher brain expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (a rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis), but unaltered expression of dopamine-Î²-hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase (the enzymes of dopamine metabolism). This response may underlie chronic amitriptyline action on dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmission, and contribute to the complex CNS profile of this drug observed both clinically and in animal models. Collectively, these findings also confirm the important role of monoamine modulation in the regulation of anxiety-related behavior in zebrafish, and support the utility of this organism as a promising in-vivo model for CNS drug screening.

METH addicts often show extreme paranoia, anxiety, and depression. Thus, there is no effective medication for the treatment of METH-induced abnormalities. In the present study, we investigated the effects of l-Scoulerine (l-SLR), a tetrahydroprotoberberine (THPBS) alkaloid, on METH-induced anxiety-like behaviour in zebrafish and METH-induced addictive behavior in mice. In the novel tank test, acute administration of METH (2. mg/L) induced a significant decrease in the number of total vertical transitions and time spent in the upper zone. Moreover, METH produced significant avoidance behaviour showing increased swimming time in the central area and high speed movement in the mirror area in the mirror stimulation test; these anxiety-like changes were attenuated by l-SLR. Chronic administration of METH (2. mg/kg) produced a steady increase in locomotor activity and conditioned place preference in mice. l-SLR (5. mg/kg) failed to reduce acute METH-induced hyperlocomotion, but attenuated chronic METH-induced behavioural sensitization and significantly blocked the expression of conditioned place preference induced by METH in mice.

A possible strategy to achieve clinical benefits is drug repurposing, i.e., discovery of novel applications for old drugs, bringing new treatment options to the market and to the patients who need them. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a commonly used mucolytic and paracetamol antidote, has emerged as a promising molecule for the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders. The mechanism of action of this drug is complex, and involves modulation of antioxidant, inflammatory, neurotrophic and glutamate pathways. Here we evaluated the effects of NAC on behavioral parameters relevant to anxiety in zebrafish. NAC did not alter behavioral parameters in the novel tank test, prevented the anxiety-like behaviors induced by an acute stressor (net chasing), and increased the time zebrafish spent in the lit side in the light/dark test. These data may indicate that NAC presents an anti-stress effect, with the potential to prevent stress-induced psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression.

The effects observed in this condition are related to the increase in alcohol metabolites and imbalance in oxidative status. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a mucolytic agent and an antidote for paracetamol overdose. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that NAC is a multi-target drug acting through neuroprotective, antioxidant and neurotrophic mechanisms as well as a glutamate modulator. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of NAC in zebrafish acutely exposed to ethanol (EtOH). Animals pretreated or not with NAC (1Â mg/L, 10Â min) were exposed for 60Â min to standard tank water (EtOHâˆ’) or to 1% EtOH (EtOH+) to evaluate anxiety-like behavior and locomotion in the novel tank test and oxidative damage in the brain. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to EtOH displayed a decrease in the distance traveled, crossings, entries and time spent in the top area in the novel tank test. Exposure to EtOH also caused oxidative damage, shown by increased lipid peroxidation, decreased non-protein thiols and increased production of reactive oxygen species (DCF assay). NAC prevented both the behavioral alterations and the oxidative stress observed in EtOH+ animals. Given the effects of NAC in preventing the acute behavioral and biochemical effects of EtOH, additional studies are warranted to further investigate the basis of its anecdotal use to prevent hangover.

As a multi-target drug and a glutathione precursor, NAC is a promising molecule in the management of stress-related disorders, for which there is an expanding field of research investigating novel therapies targeting oxidative pathways. The deleterious effects of chronic stress in the central nervous system are a result of glutamatergic hyperactivation, glutathione (GSH) depletion, oxidative stress, and increased inflammatory response, among others.

Animals were initially stressed or not for 7Â days, followed by treatment with NAC (1Â mg/L, 10Â min) or vehicle for 7Â days. UCS decreased the number of entries and time spent in the top area in the novel tank test, which indicate increased anxiety levels. It also increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and lipid peroxidation (TBARS) while decreased non-protein thiols (NPSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity.

This study aims at investigating the glucose-lowering and neuroprotective capability of Diosgenin (DG) towards hyperglycemia-induced cerebral injury in a developed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) Zebrafish (ZF) model. T2DM was developed in ZF with 20 mg/kg body weight (b.w) multiple-low dose (MLD) Streptozotocin (STZ) for 28 days. Different doses of 20 mg/kg b.w (DG1) and 40 mg/kg b.w (DG2) DG was intraperitoneally administered twice in 7 days for a period of 28 days after T2DM was completely developed. Weight and behavioral changes were monitored and the catalytic activity including the plasma glucose level of diseased and treated ZF was spectrometrically estimated. Histopathological studies were employed to image the brain pathological condition during disease and treatment. SPSS was used as the statistical tool for result analysis and comparison of data obtained. STZ significantly (###p &lt; 0.001) induced hyperglycemia when compared to control as plasma glucose increases from 101.56 Â± 4.52 mgdLâˆ’1 to 175.87 Â± 6.00 mg/dL.

Histopathological analysis confirmed the cerebral cortex with inflammatory brain cells in the diseased condition and an attenuation of damage posed revealed in diseased state was largely reversed with DG. As compared to the normal control, a significant (#p &lt; 0.05 and ###p &lt; 0.001) changes in weight of fishes were recorded and DG1 and DG2 significantly promotes (***p &lt; 0.001) body weight and improves the irregularities in weight of ZF during disease progression.

Gaining a better understanding of these factors may help to develop therapeutic interventions in the future. Zebrafish offer a potentially useful model in this regard. Here, we introduce a zebrafish model of moderate prenatal ethanol exposure. Embryos were exposed to 20mM ethanol for seven days (48hpf-9dpf) and tested as adults for individual social behavior and shoaling. We also tested their basal anxiety with the novel tank diving test. We found that the ethanol-exposed fish displayed reductions in social approach and shoaling, and an increase in anxiety in the novel tank test. These behavioral differences corresponded to differences in hrt1aa, slc6a4 and oxtr expression. Namely, acute ethanol caused a spike in oxtr and ht1aa mRNA expression, which was followed by down-regulation at 7dpf, and an up-regulation in slc6a4 at 72hpf. This study confirms the utility of zebrafish as a model system for studying the molecular basis of developmental ethanol exposure. Furthermore, it proposes a putative developmental mechanism characterized by ethanol-induced OT inhibition leading to suppression of 5-HT and up-regulation of 5-HT1A, which leads, in turn, to possible homeostatic up-regulation of 5-HTT at 72hpf and subsequent imbalance of the 5-HT system.

Currently, the effects of juvenile fluoxetine exposure in rodent models appear to be dependent on the developmental window targeted as well as the duration of drug exposure. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) model is rapidly becoming a useful tool in pharmacological research and can be used to help elucidate some of the long-term effects of fluoxetine exposure prior to sexual maturation on neuroendocrine and behavioral stress markers. In the current study, juvenile zebrafish were chronically exposed to fluoxetine hydrochloride (0 or 100 mg/L) for 14 days (31-44 days post-fertilization (dpf)), then were left untreated until young adulthood. Starting at 90 dpf, basal neuroendocrine stress and behavioral responses of zebrafish were assessed. Cortisol was extracted from the young adult zebrafish body (trunk) and quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anxiety-like behaviors were assessed in response to introduction to the novel tank test. It was expected that juvenile exposure to fluoxetine would (1) reduce basal cortisol levels and (2) elicit anxiolytic effects in the novel tank test in adulthood. However, fluoxetine exposure during the juvenile period was not associated with alterations in basal levels of cortisol nor were there any significant changes in anxiety-like behavior in the young adult zebrafish. Thus, in zebrafish, it does not appear that SSRI exposure during the juvenile period has a long-term adverse or maladaptive impact on the basal expression of cortisol and anxiety-like behavior in adulthood. Further studies are needed to determine if SSRI exposure during this developmental window influences neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to acute stress. Â© 2019 Petrunich-Rutherford."

The consequences of exposure to combinations of different classes of drugs in fish are largely unknown. In this study, we exposed adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) males and females for two weeks to low, environmentally relevant concentrations of the endocrine disrupting chemical 17Î±-etinylestradiol (EE2) and the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram, alone and in combination, and analyzed behaviors of importance for population fitness, scototaxis (light/dark preference), the novel tank test and shoal cohesion. Control water contained 0.4 ng/L EE2 and the measured exposure concentrations were 0.9 ng/L EE2 (nominal 0.1) and 1 ng/L EE2 (nominal 0.5). The measured concentrations of citalopram were 0.1 (nominal 0.1) and 0.4 Î¼g/L (nominal 0.5). Both EE2 exposures increased anxiety in males in the scototaxis test, with significantly longer latency periods before entering and fewer visits to the white zone of the tank. The combined exposures (0.9 ng/L EE2 + 0.1 Î¼g/L citalopram and 1 ng/L EE2 + 0.4 Î¼g/L citalopram) resulted in abolishment of effects of EE2, with shorter latency period and more transitions to white than for fish exposed to EE2 alone. In the novel tank test, the results surprisingly indicated lower anxiety after both EE2 and citalopram exposure. Significantly more transitions to the upper half of the tank observed in males exposed to 0.1 Î¼g/L citalopram alone compared to control males. Males exposed to EE2 (0.9 ng/L) had shorter latency period to the upper half. Combination exposure resulted in a longer latency and fewer transitions to the upper half compared to both control, EE2- and citalopram-exposed males. Males exposed to the combination spent significantly less time in the upper half than males EE2 or citalopram-exposed males. Females exposed to 1 ng/L EE2 had fewer transitions to the upper half than the control group and females exposed to 0.4 Î¼g/L citalopram. In the shoaling test, males exposed to 0.1 Î¼g/L citalopram + 0.9 ng/L EE2 showed more transitions away from peers than males exposed to 0.1 Î¼g/L citalopram alone. In conclusion, low concentrations of EE2, closely above the predicted no effect concentration (NOEC) of 0.1 ng/L, created anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish males. Citalopram showed marginal effects at these low concentrations but in the combination exposure the behavioral effects of EE2 were abolished.

The effects were, however, opposite for the two concentrations. Fish that were exposed to 5 ng/L had longer latency before upswim, fewer transitions to the upper half and shorter total time spent in the upper half compared with control fish, while 25 ng Ethinyl estradiol treatment resulted in shorter latency and more and longer visits to the upper half. The swimming activity of 25, but not 5 ng-exposed fish were slightly but significantly reduced, and these fish tended to spend a lot of time at the surface. We also studied the shoaling behavior as the tendency to leave a shoal of littermates trapped behind a Plexiglas barrier at one end of the test tank. The fish treated with Ethinyl estradiol had significantly longer latency before leaving shoal mates and left the shoal fewer times. Further, the fish exposed to 5 ng/L also spent significantly less time away from shoal than control fish. Fertilization frequency was higher in males exposed to 5 ng/L Ethinyl estradiol when compared with control males, while no spawning was observed after treatment with 25 ng/L. The testes from both treatment groups contained a normal distribution of spermatogenesis stages, and no abnormality in testis morphology could be observed.In conclusion, we have observed effects on two behaviors not related to reproduction in zebra fish males after treatment with Ethinyl estradiol, adding to the ecological consequences of contamination of aquatic environments with estrogenic substances.

Several characteristics have been described for this species, including scototaxis, which is the natural preference for dark environments in detriment of bright ones. However, there is no evidence regarding the influence of ""natural stimuli"" in zebrafish subjected to novelty-based paradigms. In this report, we evaluated the spatio-temporal exploratory activity of the short-fin zebrafish phenotype in the open tank after a short-period confinement into dark/bright environments. A total of 44 animals were individually confined during a 10-min single session into one of three environments: black-painted, white-painted, and transparent cylinders (dark, bright, and transparent groups). Fish were further subjected to the novel tank test and their exploratory profile was recorded during a 15-min trial. The results demonstrated that zebrafish increased their vertical exploratory activity during the first 6-min, where the bright group spent more time and travelled a higher distance in the top area. Interestingly, all behavioral parameters measured for the dark group were similar to the transparent one. These data were confirmed by automated analysis of track and occupancy plots and also demonstrated that zebrafish display a classical homebase formation in the bottom area of the tank. A detailed spatio-temporal study of zebrafish exploratory behavior and the construction of representative ethograms showed that the experimental groups presented significant differences in the first 3-min vs. last 3-min of test. Although the main factors involved in these behavioral responses still remain ambiguous and require further investigation, the current report describes an alternative methodological approach for assessing the zebrafish behavior after a forced exposure to different environments. Additionally, the analysis of ethologically-relevant patterns across time could be a potential phenotyping tool to evaluate the zebrafish exploratory profile in the open tank task.

Here, we explore the effects of a wide range (0.25-120 mg/l) of acute MDMA doses on zebrafish behavior in the novel tank test. Although MDMA was inactive at lower doses (0.25-10 mg/l), higher doses reduced bottom swimming and immobility (40-120 mg/l) and impaired intrasession habituation (10-120 mg/l). MDMA also elevated brain c-fos expression, collectively confirming the usage of zebrafish models for screening of hallucinogenic compounds.

Mounting evidence supports the utility of zebrafish (Danio rerio) for studying various pharmacological manipulations, as an alternative model complementing the existing rodent paradigms in this field. Here, we explore the effects of acute 20-min exposure to two commonly abused psychotropic compounds, Î”9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and heroin, on adult zebrafish behavior in the novel tank test. Overall, THC administration (30 and 50 mg/L) produces an anxiogenic-like reduction of top swimming, paralleled with a slower, continuous bottom swimming. In contrast, heroin exposure (15 and 25 mg/L) evoked a hyperlocomotor response (with rapid bouts of bottom swimming and frequent 'bouncing' motions) without altering anxiety-sensitive top/bottom endpoints. The behavioral effects of these two compounds in zebrafish seem to parallel the respective rodent and human findings. Collectively, this emphasizes the growing significance of novel emerging aquatic models in translational drug abuse research and small molecule screening. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V."

Mounting evidence of their potential utility in clinical and experimental psychopharmacology, necessitates new models and novel model organisms for their screening. Here, we characterize behavioral effects of mafedine (6-oxo-1-phenyl-2- (phenylamino)-1,6-dihydropyrimidine-4-sodium olate), a novel drug with alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonistic effects, in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in the novel tank test of anxiety and activity. Following an acute 20-min exposure, mafedine at 60 mg/L produced a mild psychostimulant action with some anxiogenic-like effects. Repeated acute 20-min/day administration of mafedine for 7 consecutive days at 1, 5 and 10 mg/L had a similar action on fish behavior as an acute exposure to 60 mg/L. Since mafedine demonstrated robust behavioral effects in zebrafish â€“ a sensitive vertebrate aquatic model, it is likely that it may modulate rodent and human behavior as well. Thus, further studies are needed to explore this possibility in detail, and whether it may foster clinical application of mafedine and related alpha-2 adrenergic agents. Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V."

Long-term use may cause a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome. Melatonin (MT) could ameliorate depression behavior. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the antidepressant effects of venlafaxine in combination with melatonin on zebrafish. Reserpine was used to induce depression-like behavioral zebrafish. To explore the effects of combined use of venlafaxine and melatonin on depression-like zebrafish induced by reserpine. We tested the depressive behavior of adult zebrafish through a novel tank test, and evaluated the levels of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) in zebrafish brain using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), besides that the gene expression of serotonin transporters a (serta), dopamine transporters (dat) and norepinephrine transporters (net), vesicular monoamine transporter2 (vmat2) and monoamine oxidase (mao) were evaluated by qRT-PCR. The results showed that, compared with reserpine-only group, venlafaxine (VEN, 0.025 mg/L) and melatonin (MT, 1 Î¼M) increased the parameters of exploration in the top of the tank and decreased freezing behavior significantly. Compared with reserpine-only group, the use of VEN combined with MT increased serotonin and norepinephrine levels significantly, while there was no obvious difference in dopamine content. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the use of VEN combined with MT significantly reduced the expression of serta and promoted the expression of vmat2, but had no significant effect on the expression of net, dat and mao. The results indicated that venlafaxine combined with melatonin showed more effective role to remedy the depressive symptoms in zebrafish, providing a reference for the clinical application of antidepressants.

"Tran, S. and Facciol, A. and Gerlai, R.",Alcohol-induced behavioral changes in zebrafish: The role of dopamine D2-like receptors,2016,Psychopharmacology,233,11,2119-2128,"Rationale: The dopaminergic system has been proposed to mediate alcohol-induced locomotor activity, yet the mechanisms underlying this behavioral response remain poorly understood. Objectives: This study was conducted to investigate the role of dopamine D2-like receptors in mediating alcohol-induced behavioral responses. Methods: In experiment 1, we examined the effects of high concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10Â Î¼M) of haloperidol on motor responses. In experiment 2, we examined the effects of low concentrations (0, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5Â Î¼M) of haloperidol on anxiety-like behavioral responses using the novel tank test. In experiment 3, we examined the effect of pre-treating zebrafish with different concentrations of haloperidol (0, 0.625, 2.5Â Î¼M) and subsequently exposing them to 0 or 1Â % alcohol. Results: In experiment 1, haloperidol induced an inverted U-shaped concentration-dependent increase in locomotor activity. In experiment 2, haloperidol (2.5Â Î¼M) reduced the absolute turn angle and freezing behavior in a new environment. In experiment 3, acute alcohol exposure significantly increased locomotor activity and decreased anxiety-like behavioral responses. Pre-treating zebrafish with the lower dose of haloperidol (0.625Â Î¼M) abolished the alcohol-induced locomotor activity, without altering anxiety-like behavioral responses. However, pre-treating with the higher dose of haloperidol (2.5Â Î¼M) abolished both alcohol-induced increase of locomotor activity and reduction of anxiety-like behavioral responses. Conclusion: The results suggest alcohol-induced locomotor hyperactivity in zebrafish is mediated via activation of dopamine D2-like receptors, whereas anxiety-like behavioral responses may only be altered by a high haloperidol concentration, at which dose the drug may affect receptors other than D2-R.

"Tran, S. and Gerlai, R.T.",The novel tank test: Handling stress and the context specific psychopharmacology of anxiety,2016,Current Psychopharmacology,5,2,169-179,"Background. The zebrafish has become a popular animal model for behavioral pharmacology. One of the greatest advantages of the zebrafish is its amenability for high throughput screens to identify anxiety altering compounds. The novel tank diving test is arguably one of the most commonly utilized behavioral tests for quantifying anxiety-like behavioral responses in zebrafish. However, a number of context-dependent anxiety-like behavioral responses have recently been reported in the literature for this task, and the validity of using a single measure, the diving response, has been questioned. Objective. In this review, we discuss multiple behavioral parameters that can be used to evaluate performance in the novel tank diving test which can serve as indicators of anxiety. In addition, we also discuss the difficulties associated with interpretation of behavioral measures of anxiety, a question complicated by context-dependent behavioral responses induced by handling the fish with a net, a known stressor. Conclusion. The zebrafish is a relative newcomer in the psychopharmacological analysis of anxiety, but the increasing number of efficient behavioural tests and the translational relevance of this species make the zebrafish a potentially useful laboratory species for screening of anxiolytic compounds.

In this study we used the novel tank test (NTT) to analyze zebrafish exploring behavior after four monthsâ€™ supplementation with probiotics with probed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Results showed that prolonged ingestion of Lactobacillus rhamnosus CECT8361 and Bifidobacterium longum CECT7347 significantly alters the swimming pattern and mean swimming speed in the zebrafish model. After treatment, zebrafish strongly reduced their bottom-dwelling geotactic behavior when placed in a new tank, which could be correlated to a lower state of anxiety. Â© 2020"

However, whether Vmat2-deficiency is related to the anxiety is rarely investigated, especially in zebrafish. Here, we reported Vmat2 heterzygous mutant zebrafish displayed anxiety-like behavior. The mutants spent less time in the top area and took longer latency to the top in the novel tank test. Consistently, they showed dark avoidance in the light/dark box test, with longer duration in the light zone and increased number of crossing between the two zones. Monoamine concentration analysis showed that the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters including dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxy tryptamine (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE), as well as their metabolites were decreased in VMAT mutants. Taken together, these findings suggest that Vmat2 heterzygous mutant zebrafish may serve as a new model of anxiety, which may be related with the low level of DA, 5-HT and NE. Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Although zebrafish (Danio rerio) are increasingly utilized in neurobehavioral research, their habituation responses have not been extensively investigated. Utilizing the novel tank test, we examine intra- and inter-session habituation and demonstrate robust habituation responses in adult zebrafish. Analyzing the intra-session habituation to novelty further, we also show that selected anxiogenic drugs (caffeine, pentylenetetrazole), as well as stress-inducing alarm pheromone, attenuated zebrafish habituation. Some acute anxiolytic agents, such as morphine and ethanol, while predictably reducing zebrafish anxiety, had no effects on habituation. Chronic ethanol and fluoxetine treatments improved intra-session habituation in zebrafish. In general, our study parallels literature on rodent habituation responses to novelty, and reconfirms zebrafish as a promising model for cognitive neurobehavioral research. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, pharmacological therapeutic approaches display undesirable side effects for patients, particularly when long-term therapy is required. Some evidences have suggested that Coriandrum sativum extract (CSE) provide sedative and anxiolytic effects. We investigate if CSE could attenuate anxiety-like behaviors induced by novelty and alarm substance exposures in zebrafish. Adult zebrafish were injected with vehicle, clonazepam, or CSE (25, 50 or 100 mg/kg) and submitted to novel tank test. At the end, saline or alarm substance was added and anxiety-like responses were recorded. Twenty-four hours after, fish were submitted to the light/dark test. Novelty associated with alarm substance exposure decreased distance traveled and total time mobile in novel tank, and CSE (at 50 and 100 mg/kg) prevented these alterations similarly to clonazepam. Alarm substance reduced the time spent in white compartment (p = 0.0193 as compared with vehicle group). Clonazepam and CSE prevented this anxiogenic effect of alarm substance. CSE presents anxiolytic effects against alarm substance-induced locomotor and anxiogenic responses similarly to clonazepam. These data corroborate with the use of this plant in traditional medicine and provides a putative new pharmacological intervention for anxiety disorders.
