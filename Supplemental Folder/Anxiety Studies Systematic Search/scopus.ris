AB  - Neuropeptide Y (NPY) controls energy homeostasis including orexigenic actions in mammalians and non-mammalians. Recently, NPY has attracted attention as a mediator of emotional behaviour and psychosomatic diseases. However, its functions are not fully understood. We established npy gene-deficient (NPY-KO) zebrafish (Danio rerio) to assess the relationship between NPY and emotional behaviours. The NPY-KO zebrafish exhibited similar growth, but pomc and avp mRNA levels in the brain were higher as compared to wild-type fish. NPY-KO zebrafish exhibited several anxiety-like behaviours, such as a decrease in social interaction in mirror test and decreased locomotion in black-white test. The acute cold stress-treated NPY-KO zebrafish exhibited anxiety-like behaviours such as remaining stationary and swimming along the side of the tank in the mirror test. Moreover, expression levels of anxiety-associated genes (orx and cck) and catecholamine production (gr, mr, th1 and th2) were significantly higher in NPY-KO zebrafish than in wild-type fish. We demonstrated that NPY-KO zebrafish have an anxiety phenotype and a stress-vulnerability like NPY-KO mice, whereby orx and/or catecholamine signalling may be involved in the mechanism actions. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The use of herbicides with glyphosate as an active ingredient (a.i.) has increased dramatically in recent years, with its residues often being found in either soil or water. Nevertheless, concerns have arisen about its harmful side effects for both ecosystems and wildlife health. Therefore, the objective of this work was to assess the effects of a commercial formulation of glyphosate (RoundUp® UltraMax), at environmentally relevant concentrations on zebrafish embryos through a set of behavioural patterns. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 1, 2 and 5 μg a.i. mL−1 concentrations of the glyphosate formulation for 72 h (from 2.5 to 75 h post-fertilization (hpf)). After exposure, larvae were washed and allowed to develop until 144 hpf. At this point, the larvae behaviour was evaluated using a battery of tests to assess the general exploratory motility, escape-like responses, anxiety-related behaviours and social interactions. In addition, cortisol levels were assessed. No significant changes were observed relative to the exploratory behaviour in the standard open field. The anxiety-related behaviours were similar among groups, and no social interference was observed following exposure to these glyphosate concentrations. Likewise, cortisol levels remained similar among treatments. Still, the larvae exposed to 5 μg a.i. mL−1 did not react to the presence of an aversive stimulus, supporting glyphosate-induced changes in the sensory-motor coordination during development. In general, these results indicate a possible neurotoxic effect of this glyphosate-based formulation that should be further evaluated. In addition, the results obtained could impose a risk for wildlife sensitive species that should not be neglected. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Stress is a common trigger of stress-related illnesses, such as anxiety, phobias, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Various animal models successfully reproduce core behaviors of these clinical conditions. Here, we develop a novel zebrafish model of stress (potentially relevant to human stress-related disorders), based on delayed persistent behavioral, endocrine and genomic responses to an acute severe ‘combined’ stressor. Specifically, one week after adult zebrafish were exposed to a complex combined 90-min stress, we assessed their behaviors in the novel tank and the light-dark box tests, as well as whole-body cortisol and brain gene expression, focusing on genomic biomarkers of microglia, astrocytes, neuroinflammation, apoptosis and epigenetic modulation. Overall, stressed fish displayed persistent anxiety-like behavior, elevated whole-body cortisol, as well as upregulated brain mRNA expression of genes encoding the glucocorticoid receptor, neurotrophin BDNF and its receptors (TrkB and P75), CD11b (a general microglial biomarker), COX-2 (an M1-microglial biomarker), CD206 (an M2-microglial biomarker), GFAP (a general astrocytal biomarker), C3 (an A1-astrocytal biomarker), S100α10 (an A2-astrocytal biomarker), as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-γ and TNF-α. Stress exposure also persistently upregulated the brain expression of several key apoptotic (Bax, Caspase-3, Bcl-2) and epigenetic genes (DNMT3a, DNMT3b, HAT1, HDAC4) in these fish. Collectively, the present model not only successfully recapitulates lasting behavioral and endocrine symptoms of clinical stress-related disorders, but also implicates changes in neuroglia, neuroinflammation, apoptosis and epigenetic modulation in long-term effects of stress pathogenesis in vivo. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Due to its multifactorial and yet to be fully understood origin, ethanol addiction is a field that still requires studies for the elucidation of novel genes and pathways that potentially influence the establishment and maintenance of addiction-like phenotypes. In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate the role of the LRRK2 pathway in the modulation of ethanol preference behavior in Zebrafish (Danio rerio). Using the behavioral Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) paradigm, we accessed the preference of animals for ethanol. Next, we evaluated the transcriptional regulation of the gene lrrk2 and the receptors drd1, drd2, grin1a, gria2a, and gabbr1b in the zebrafish brain. Additionally, we used a selective inhibitor of Lrrk2 (GNE-0877) to assess the role of this gene in the preference behavior. Our results revealed four distinct ethanol preference phenotypes (Light, Heavy, Negative Reinforcement, and Inflexible), each showing different transcriptional regulation patterns of the drd1, drd2, grin1a, gria2a, and gabbr1b receptors. We showed that the lrrk2 gene was hyperregulated only in the brains of the animals with the Inflexible phenotype. Most importantly, we showed, for the first time in the context of preference for ethanol, that treatment with the GNE-0877 inhibitor modulates the transcription of the target receptor genes and reduces the preference for ethanol in the animals of the Inflexible group. This result corroborates the hypothesis that the LRRK2 pathway is involved in the inflexible preference for ethanol behavior. Lastly, we identified a possible pharmacological target for the treatment of abusive preference behavior for ethanol. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Nitric oxide has been implicated in symptoms of ethanol withdrawal in animal models. Zebrafish have been used as models to study neurobehavioral effects of ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal, but the mechanisms associated with these effects are not yet clear. Adult zebrafish were treated with 1% EtOH for 20 min per day for 8 days, injected with the nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS-2) inhibitor aminoguanidine (50 mg/kg), and allowed to experience withdrawal (WD) in their hometanks for 7 days. EtOH WD increased anxiety-like behavior in the novel tank test, an effect that was blocked by aminoguanidine. EtOH WD also increased brain levels of nitrite, an effect that was partially blocked by aminoguanidine. These results underline a novel mechanism by which NOS-2 controls anxiety-like responses to ethanol withdrawal, with implications for the mechanistic study of symptoms associated with chronic ethanol abuse.

AB  - Ethanol consumption is correlated with different neurobiological and behavioral impairments. Acute and chronic exposure to this drug is associated with alterations in the regulation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system as well as with transcriptional modulation of other receptors in the central nervous system and can unleash seeking behavior or behavioral adaptations and phenotypes such as loss of control, dependence and tolerance. In the present work, we characterized the chronological effects of acute and chronic intermittent exposure to ethanol (1% v/v) in an adult zebrafish population (Danio rerio). During sixteen days of ethanol exposure, we associated the neuromodulation of target genes (drd1, drd2, gabra2a, gabbr1a, gabbr1b) in the central nervous system with behavioral parameters, assessed by social preference, antipredatory capacity and anxiety-like analysis. Transcriptional and behavioral data were collected in days 0, 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16, after ethanol exposure. In days 1 and 4, ethanol exposure increased exploratory behavior regardless of the risk involved (less time spent close to conspecifics and lower avoidance reaction to predator). Along with the reduction of drd2, grin1a and gabra2a transcription seen in the same days, these results suggest an anxiolytic effect of acute ethanol exposure. Interestingly, in days 8, 12 and 16, an attenuation of the behavioral effects was observed. The social preference, antipredatory behavior, perception and exploration parameters were reconstituted. This behavioral re-establishment, accompanied by the increase in drd1, drd2 and gabbr1a transcription in the 8th day could be an indicative of an adaptation to chronic exposure to ethanol. The modulation of drd2 gene combined with the behavioral characterization observed in the study suggests this signalling pathway as a key participant in the phenotypic outcomes of a long-term chronic exposure to ethanol. Lastly, our results reaffirm the ethanol deleterious impacts in perception, ability to respond to adverse stimuli and in anxiety-like behavior. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

There is increasing evidence that gut microbiome could have effects on neurological processes and on behavior. In this study we used the novel tank test (NTT) to analyze zebrafish exploring behavior after four months’ supplementation with probiotics with probed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Results showed that prolonged ingestion of Lactobacillus rhamnosus CECT8361 and Bifidobacterium longum CECT7347 significantly alters the swimming pattern and mean swimming speed in the zebrafish model. After treatment, zebrafish strongly reduced their bottom-dwelling geotactic behavior when placed in a new tank, which could be correlated to a lower state of anxiety. © 2020

AB  - Prior exposure to drugs of abuse may facilitate addiction. It has been described that pre-exposure to nicotine can increase or, contrarily, prevent conditioned place preference (CPP). Here, we evaluated the effect of nicotine pre-exposure on CPP performance using an original protocol mimicking smokers’ behaviour in zebrafish. We simulated nicotine withdrawal at sleep time by exposing zebrafish to nicotine during daylight but not at night (D/N) for 14 days and then performed nicotine-CPP in zebrafish. D/N-nicotine-treated zebrafish obtained the highest CPP score, whereas zebrafish pre-exposed continuously to nicotine did not show nicotine-CPP. Evaluation of locomotor activity, seeking and anxiety-like behaviours supported the CPP findings. Nicotinic receptor subunit gene expression showed significant increases in the brain of zebrafish exposed to nicotine. Zebrafish exposed to D/N-nicotine showed further increases of α6- and α7-subunit expression after CPP establishment. Inhibition of histone acetylation by phenylbutyrate prevented nicotine-CPP. Transcriptional expression of epigenetic enzymes controlling histone acetylation/deacetylation and DNA methylation/demethylation was widely modified in brain portions containing reward areas of zebrafish exposed to D/N-nicotine after CPP. Zebrafish exposed to D/N-nicotine showed high levels of acetylated histone 3 and pCREB immunoreactivity differentially found in nuclei of the dopaminergic reward circuit in zebrafish homologous to the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and dorsal habenula. Our findings demonstrated that repetitive abstinent periods are risky factors for drug abuse that potentiate nicotine–environment associations and seeking. Brain modifications can persist long after nicotine use and are likely due to changes in the transcriptional expression of enzymes regulating drug reward-related gene expression via epigenetic modifications. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Anxiety disorders appear to involve distinct neurobiological mechanisms and several medications are available against this mental health problem. However, pharmacological therapeutic approaches display undesirable side effects for patients, particularly when long-term therapy is required. Some evidences have suggested that Coriandrum sativum extract (CSE) provide sedative and anxiolytic effects. We investigate if CSE could attenuate anxiety-like behaviors induced by novelty and alarm substance exposures in zebrafish. Adult zebrafish were injected with vehicle, clonazepam, or CSE (25, 50 or 100 mg/kg) and submitted to novel tank test. At the end, saline or alarm substance was added and anxiety-like responses were recorded. Twenty-four hours after, fish were submitted to the light/dark test. Novelty associated with alarm substance exposure decreased distance traveled and total time mobile in novel tank, and CSE (at 50 and 100 mg/kg) prevented these alterations similarly to clonazepam. Alarm substance reduced the time spent in white compartment (p = 0.0193 as compared with vehicle group). Clonazepam and CSE prevented this anxiogenic effect of alarm substance. CSE presents anxiolytic effects against alarm substance-induced locomotor and anxiogenic responses similarly to clonazepam. These data corroborate with the use of this plant in traditional medicine and provides a putative new pharmacological intervention for anxiety disorders. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.

AB  - Embryonic and larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavior is commonly used to identify neurotoxic compounds. Here, we investigated whether sub-lethal exposures to the common solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 0.01–1%) and methanol (MeOH, 0.01–1%), or the anti-fungal agent methylene blue (MB, 0.0001–0.0005%), can influence larval behavior in a simple light/dark paradigm conducted in 96-well plates. In addition, we tested whether the media volume within the behavioral arena or the zebrafish strain, AB wild type, AB Tübingen (AB/TU), or Tüpfel long-fin (TL), could also influence larval behavior. Following the single exposures, we co-exposed larvae to DMSO and either MB or two other compounds with known behavioral effects in larval zebrafish, flutamide and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). We found ≥0.55% DMSO and 0.0005% MB significantly affected larval behavior, but there was no effect of MeOH. Similarly, TL showed less movement compared to AB and AB/TU strains, whereas lower media volumes also significantly reduced larval movement. However, all strains responded similarly to DMSO and MB. In the co-exposure studies, we found either additive or interaction effects between DMSO and either MB, flutamide, or PFOS, depending on the behavioral endpoint measured. In addition, media volume had no effect on the DMSO concentration response curve, but again we observed additive effects on behavior. In conclusion, methodology can lead to alterations in baseline locomotor activity and compounds can have additive or interaction effects on behavioral endpoints. However, we found no evidence that strain effects should be a concern when deciding on solvents for a simple light/dark behavioral test in larval zebrafish. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - Environmental contaminants such as metal ions can have detrimental effects on aquatic organisms at the molecular, organismal and population levels. In the present work, we examined the interactive effect of Cu(II) and conspecific alarm substance on zebrafish behavioural responses utilizing the novel tank diving assay. To this end, 3 novel tank diving tests (on day 0, 3 and 10 of the experimental phase) were conducted on zebrafish in 4 experimental groups: (1) control: no Cu(II) and no alarm substance, (2) Cu(II) only: exposed to 0.78 μM Cu(II) (25 % of the 240 h LC50) in the home tank for 10 days, (3) alarm substance only: exposed to alarm substance for 6 min concomitant with behavioural testing, and (4) Cu(II) + alarm substance: exposed to 0.78 μM Cu(II) in the home tank for 10 days and treated with alarm substance for 6 min during the behavioural testing. Results showed robust habituation response of zebrafish. Exposure to Cu(II) did not affect the behavioural phenotypes of zebrafish in the novel tank diving test or habituation responses. Alarm substance treatment evoked strong anxiety-like behaviour. Finally, zebrafish in the Cu(II) + alarm substance group lost their sensitivity to alarm substance in repeated novel tank assays throughout the concomitant Cu(II) exposure; this observation is tentatively ascribed to Cu(II)-induced olfactory impairment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recently, artificial sweeteners have received widespread attention as the emerging environmental pollutants, among which, acesulfame (ACE) is ubiquitously present and extremely persistent in the ecosystem. Although the environmental behavior of ACE has already been well studied, its chronic eco-toxicological effects on aquatic organisms are rarely reported. Thus, more researches should be performed to determine the concentration which exerted the observable toxicological effect. Herein, we examined neuro-behavioral effects of ACE at 1, 10 and 100 mg/L on adult zebrafish via performing the behavioral test batteries including light/dark preference test, novel tank diving test, novel object exploration test, social preference test and colour-enhanced CPP test. In addition, in order to fully phenotype the behavioral alteration induced by ACE, we applied the techniques deriving from behavioral phenomics to analyze and interpret the big data from a large number of behavioral variables. Furthermore, the alterations of neurotransmitter in brain were also assayed to confirm the behavioral results. We found that ACE within the concentration range of No Observed Effect Concentrations (NOECs) had remarkably altered the neuro-behavioral profiles: altered the preference for light/dark, reduced the exploration ability of zebrafish in the novel tank and novel object exploration test, affected the group preference of zebrafish, changed the colour preference, learning and memory ability of zebrafish and disturbed the quantitative patterns of neurotransmitter in brain. As a result, this research can offer a reference for readjusting the NOECs of ACE and assessing neurotoxicity of artificial sweeteners. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is rapidly emerging as an important model species in neuroscience research. Neurobehavioral studies in zebrafish are typically based on automated video-tracking of individual or group fish responses to various stressors, drug treatments and genetic manipulations. However, moving zebrafish also emit vibration signals that can be recorded and characterized. New method: Here, we present the first evidence that vibration-based analyses can be used to assess zebrafish behaviors. Utilizing a free accelerometer smartphone application, we developed a simple inexpensive custom-made setup to detect vibration signals in adult zebrafish. Results: We demonstrate that moving zebrafish generate detectable, reproducible vibration power frequency spectra that may be sensitive to various experimental manipulations, including sedative and anxiolytic treatments. Comparison with existing methods: The present study is the first report describing vibration-based behavioral characterization in zebrafish. Conclusions: The present proof-of-concept study expands the toolkit of zebrafish neurophenotyping methods to include vibration data, which may not only reflect major global changes in zebrafish locomotion (e.g., sedation or hyperactivity), but can also eventually help detect more nuanced, behavior- or context-specific changes in zebrafish phenotypes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tributyltin (TBT), an aromatase inhibitor, has been found to disrupt gametogenesis and reproductive behavior in several fish species. However, whether TBT is capable of affecting other behaviors such as aggressive behavior and fear response in fish and the underlying mode(s) of action remain unclear. To study aggressive behavior, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) males were continuously exposed to two nominal concentrations of TBT (TBT-low, 100 ng/L and TBT-high, 500 ng/L) for 28 days. To study the fear response, the fish were divided into four groups (Blank and Control, 0 ng/L TBT; TBT-low, 100 ng/L; and TBT-high, 500 ng/L). The fish were then treated with DW (Blank) or with alarm substance (AS) (Control, TBT-low and TBT-high). After exposure, the aggressive behavior of the fish was tested using the mirror test (mirror-biting frequency, approaches to the mirror and duration in approach zone).and fighting test (fish-biting frequency) The mirror-biting frequency, approaches to the mirror, duration in approach zone and fish-biting frequency of the TBT-exposed fish increased significantly compared to those of the control fish, indicating enhanced aggressive behavior. The fear response parameters tested using the novel tank dive test (onset time to the higher half, total duration in the lower half and the frequency of turning) of the TBT-exposed fish were also significantly increased after AS administration, suggesting an enhanced fear response. Further investigation revealed that TBT treatment elevated the plasma level of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) and decreased the plasma level of estradiol (E2) in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, TBT up-regulated the mRNA levels of ar, c-fos and bdnf1, and suppressed the expression of btg-2 in fish. In addition, exposure to AS increased the plasma level of cortisol and down-regulated the mRNA expression levels of genes involved in 5-HT synthesis (such as tph1b and pet1) in both control and TBT-treated fish. AS significantly suppressed the mRNA level of tph1b, tph2, pet1 and npy in the TBT-high group compared to the control fish. The present study demonstrates that TBT enhances aggressive behavior and fear responses in male zebrafish probably through altering plasma levels of 11-KT, E2 and cortisol and altering the expression of genes involved in the regulation of aggressive behavior (ar, c-fos, bdnf1 and btg-2) and fear responses (tph1b, tph2, pet1 and npy). The present study greatly extends our understanding of the behavioral toxicity of TBT to fish. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Taurine (TAU) is a β-amino sulfonic acid with pleiotropic roles in the brain, including the neuromodulatory activity via GABAergic and glycinergic agonism. This molecule is found at high concentrations in energy drinks and is often mixed with alcohol in beverages. Although TAU has a neuroprotective role in the brain, the putative risks of mixing TAU and EtOH are not fully understood. Here, we investigated whether TAU modulates locomotor and anxiety-like behavior in adult zebrafish by using the novel tank and light-dark tests following acute EtOH exposure at anxiogenic and anxiolytic concentrations. Zebrafish were individually exposed to water (control), TAU (42, 150, and 400 mg/L), and EtOH (0.25% (v/v) and 1% (v/v)) both independently and cotreated for 1 h. EtOH 0.25% and TAU produced U-shape anxiolytic-like behavior in the light-dark test, TAU 42 and 400 positively modulated EtOH effects, and TAU 150 exerted a protective effect. All TAU concentrations counteracted EtOH 1%-induced locomotion impairment, as well as the anxiogenic-like behavior. Finally, all TAU concentrations when given independently or cotreated with EtOH 0.25% and 1% decreased the risk assessment of the lit compartment. Principal component analyses revealed that exploration and anxiety-like responses were the main behaviors that contribute to the effects of TAU and EtOH. Overall, we demonstrate that TAU differently modulates EtOH-induced anxiolytic- and anxiogenic-like behaviors depending on the concentration, suggesting a complex mechanism underlying TAU and EtOH interactions. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Suvarna Bhasma is a gold-based Ayurved medicine that has a wide range of therapeutic indications like tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and nervous diseases. Suvarna Bhasma is also used in Suvarnaprashana, an Ayurved advocated therapy being practised to improve immunity in children. Aim of the study: To augment traditional understanding, here we present an evidence-based study on Suvarna Bhasma regarding its physicochemical properties, toxicity and efficacy. Materials and methods: Suvarna Bhasma was characterised by physicochemical characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Toxicity of Suvarna Bhasma was studied in Holtzman rats with daily oral dose from 3 mg/kg (therapeutic dose, TD) up to 30 mg/kg (10 TD) body weight for 90 days. Behavioural study, such as motor and geotactic behaviour were examined in zebrafish model to find out any sign of neurotoxicity or behavioural changes due to Suvarna Bhasma administration. Results: Suvarna Bhasma has two types of gold particles, large ones (~60 μm) having irregular shapes, and nano-sized spherical particles (starting from ~10 nm), the latter coated with Fe, Si, O, P and Na. XRD study revealed that all the peaks of Suvarna Bhasma match well with pure gold (face centred cube) with crystallites size 45 ± 2.8 nm. In rat studies, some change in biochemical parameters such as urea, creatinine and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was observed mainly at the higher therapeutic dose; however, those parameters were within the normal range. There were no significant macroscopic as well as microscopic treatment-related alteration observed, in any of the organs and tissues evaluated. In zebrafish behavioural study, the motor parameters of Suvarna Bhasma treated fish showed normal behaviour analogous to the vehicle control group. Interestingly, the geotactic behaviour showed anxiolytic effects of Suvarna Bhasma as evidenced by the time spent in the upper zone, and average swimming height. The anxiolytic effects persisted for more than 30 days after withdrawing the Suvarna Bhasma treatment. Conclusions: Suvarna Bhasma contained spherical gold nanoparticles. It was nontoxic in rat model at the does tested. Suvarna Bhasma has anxiolytic effects in zebrafish behavioural model. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We investigated the behavioural and learning response of zebrafish larvae to chemicals released by injured conspecifics (the alarm cue). Many aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates exhibit an innate antipredator response to alarm cues because in nature, they reliably indicate the presence of predators. Likewise, when an individual simultaneously perceives a novel odour and alarm cue, it learns to recognise the novel odour as a predator odour. Alarm cue-mediated behavioural response and learning have been reported in some fish and amphibians during early ontogeny, but in zebrafish, they have been described only for adults. In this study, we demonstrated that zebrafish at 12 and 24 days post fertilization exhibited reduced activity when exposed to alarm cue obtained by homogenised larvae of the same age, with this response being greater for the older zebrafish. In addition, we showed that 24-dpf zebrafish conditioned with alarm cue plus a novel odour learned to recognise the novel odour as a threat and responded to it with antipredator behaviour. The innate behavioural response and the learned response after conditioning may be used to develop paradigms with which to study anxiety, fear, stress, learning and memory in zebrafish larvae. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recent years more and more environmental pollutants have been proved neurotoxic, especially at the early development stages of organisms. Zebrafish larvae are a preeminent model for the neurobehavioral study of environmental pollutants. Here, a detailed experimental protocol is provided for the evaluation of the neurotoxicity of environmental pollutants using zebrafish larvae, including the collection of the embryos, the exposure process, neurobehavioral indicators, the test process, and data analysis. Also, the culture environment, exposure process, and experimental conditions are discussed to ensure the success of the assay. The protocol has been used in the development of psychopathic drugs, research on environmental neurotoxic pollutants, and can be optimized to make corresponding studies or be helpful for mechanistic studies. The protocol demonstrates a clear operation process for studying neurobehavioral effects on zebrafish larvae and can reveal the effects of various neurotoxic substances or pollutants. © 2020 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

AB  - Animal welfare assessment techniques try to take into consideration the specific needs and wants of the animal in question. Providing enrichment (the addition of physical objects or conspecifics in the housing environment) is often a way to give captive animals the opportunity to choose who or what they interact with and how they spend their time. A fundamental component of the aquatic environment that is often overlooked in captivity, however, is the ability for the animal to choose to engage in physical exercise. For many animals, including fish, exercise is an important aspect of their life history, and is known to have many health benefits, including positive changes in the brain and behavior. Here we present a method for assessing habitat preferences in captive animals. The protocol could easily be adapted to look at a variety of environmental factors (e.g., gravel versus sand as a substrate, plastic plants versus live plants, low flow versus high flow of water) in different aquatic species, or for use with terrestrial species. Statistical assessment of preference is carried out using Jacob's preference index, which ranks the habitats from-1 (avoidance) to +1 (most preferred). With this information, it can be determined what the animal wants from a welfare perspective, including their preferred location. © 2020 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

AB  - Coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, restricted growth and development, genital hypoplasia, ear abnormalities and/or hearing loss (CHARGE) syndrome is a congenital disorder that is mainly caused by mutations within chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (chd7). Behavioral abnormalities have been addressed in CHARGE syndrome, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we performed four behavioral tests—including the open-field test, novel-tank test, shoaling test and mirror-induced attack test—in chd7 heterozygous zebrafish mutants in order to characterize the behavioral abnormalities in a zebrafish model of CHARGE syndrome. We found that chd7 heterozygous mutants exhibited anxious-like behavior and aggressive-like behavior in the open-field test and in the mirror-induced attack test, respectively, which resembled the reported behavioral abnormalities in CHARGE syndrome in humans. Moreover, we found that glycine and D-cycloserine treatment rescued the aggressive behavior of chd7 heterozygous zebrafish mutants, indicating that the excitation and inhibition balance might be disrupted in the brains of chd7 heterozygous zebrafish mutants. Further analysis showed that the expression of glycine transporters was dramatically increased in the brains of chd7 heterozygous zebrafish mutants. Treatment with an inhibitor of glycine transporter 1, sarcosine, partially rescued the aggressive-like behavior of chd7 heterozygous zebrafish mutants. Taken together, our data suggest that the aggressive behavior in CHARGE syndrome may be due to the increased expression of glycine transporters, and inhibition of the activity of glycine transporters may be an approach to treat the behavioral abnormalities in CHARGE syndrome. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Zebrafish are becoming a species of choice in psychopharmacology, laying a promising path to refined pharmacological manipulations and high-throughput behavioral phenotyping. The field of robotics has the potential to accelerate progress along this path, by offering unprecedented means for the design and development of accurate and reliable experimental stimuli. In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, the integration of robotic predators in place conditioning experiments. We hypothesized zebrafish to be capable of forming a spatial association under a simulated predation risk. We repeatedly exposed experimental subjects to a robotic heron impacting the water surface and then evaluated their spatial avoidance within the experimental tank in a subsequent predator-free test session. To pharmacologically validate the paradigm, we tested zebrafish in drug-free conditions (control groups) or in response to three different concentrations of citalopram (30, 50, and 100 mg/L) and ethanol (0.25, 0.50, and 1.00%). Experimental data indicate that, when tested in the absence of the conditioning stimulus, zebrafish displayed a marked preference for the bottom of the test tank, that is, the farthest location from the simulated attacks by the robotic heron. This conditioned geotaxis was reduced by the administration of citalopram in a linear dose-response curve and ethanol at the low concentration. Ultimately, our data demonstrate that robotic stimuli may represent valid conditioning tools and, thereby, aid the field of zebrafish psychopharmacology. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There are numerous clinical and pre-clinical studies showing that exposure of the embryo to ethanol markedly affects neuronal development and stimulates alcohol drinking and related behaviors. In rodents and zebrafish, our studies show that embryonic exposure to low-dose ethanol, in addition to increasing voluntary ethanol intake during adolescence, increases the density of hypothalamic hypocretin (hcrt) neurons, a neuropeptide known to regulate reward-related behaviors. The question addressed here in zebrafish is whether maternal ethanol intake before conception also affects neuronal and behavioral development, phenomena suggested by clinical reports but seldom investigated. To determine if preconception maternal ethanol consumption also affects these hcrt neurons and behavior in the offspring, we first standardized a method of measuring voluntary ethanol consumption in AB strain adult and larval zebrafish given gelatin meals containing 10% or 0.1% ethanol, respectively. We found the number of bites of gelatin to be an accurate measure of intake in adults and a strong predictor of blood ethanol levels, and also to be a reliable indicator of intake in larval zebrafish. We then used this feeding paradigm and live imaging to examine the effects of preconception maternal intake of 10% ethanol-gelatin compared to plain-gelatin for 14 days on neuronal development in the offspring. Whereas ethanol consumption by adult female HuC:GFP transgenic zebrafish had no impact on the number of differentiated HuC+ neurons at 28 h post-fertilization (hpf), preconception ethanol consumption by adult female hcrt:EGFP zebrafish significantly increased the number of hcrt neurons in the offspring, an effect observed at 28 hpf and confirmed at 6 and 12 days post-fertilization (dpf). This increase in hcrt neurons was primarily present on the left side of the brain, indicating asymmetry in ethanol's actions, and it was accompanied by behavioral changes in the offspring, including a significant increase in novelty-induced locomotor activity but not thigmotaxis measured at 6 dpf and also in voluntary consumption of 0.1% ethanol-gelatin at 12 dpf. Notably, these measures of ethanol intake and locomotor activity stimulated by preconception ethanol were strongly, positively correlated with the number of hcrt neurons. These findings demonstrate that preconception maternal ethanol consumption affects the brain and behavior of the offspring, producing effects similar to those caused by embryonic ethanol exposure, and they provide further evidence that the ethanol-induced increase in hcrt neurogenesis contributes to the behavioral disturbances caused by ethanol. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous neurotransmitter that has important behavioural functions in the vertebrate brain. In this study we compare the impact of decreased nitric NO signalling upon behaviour and neurobiology using both zebrafish and mouse. nitric oxide synthase mutant (nos1−/−) zebrafish show significantly reduced aggression and an increase in anxiety-like behaviour without altered production of the stress hormone cortisol. Nos1−/− mice also exhibit decreased aggression and are hyperactive in an open field test. Upon reduction of NO signalling, monoamine neurotransmitter metabolism is reduced as a consequence of decreased Monoamine oxidase activity. Treatment of nos1−/− zebrafish with the 5-HT receptor 1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT rescues aggression and some aspects of anxiety-like behaviour. Taken together, the interplay between NO and 5-HT appears to be critical to control behaviour. Our cross-species approach challenges the previous notion that reduced neuronal NOS leads to increased aggression. Rather, Nos1 knock-out can also lead to decreased aggression in some situations, a finding that may have implications for future translational research. © 2017 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP

AB  - Rosmarinus officinalis L. is a traditional herb with various therapeutic applications such as antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, and anticholinesterase activities, and can be used for the prevention or treatment of dementia. In the present study, we tested whether Rosmarinus officinalis L. could counteract scopolamine-induced anxiety, dementia, and brain oxidative stress in the zebrafish model and tried to find the underlying mechanism. Rosmarinus officinalis L. essential oil (REO: 25, 150, and 300 µL/L) was administered by immersion to zebrafish (Danio rerio) once daily for eight days while scopolamine (100 µM) treatment was delivered 30 min before behavioral tests. The antidepressant and cognitive-enhancing actions of the essential oil in the scopolamine zebrafish model was measured in the novel tank diving test (NTT) and Y-maze test. The chemical composition was identified by Gas chromatograph–Mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The brain oxidative status and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was also determined. REO reversed scopolamine-induced anxiety, memory impairment, and brain oxidative stress. In addition, a reduced brain AChE activity following the administration of REO in scopolamine-treated fish was observed. In conclusion, REO exerted antidepressant-like effect and cognitive-enhancing action and was able to abolish AChE alteration and brain oxidative stress induced by scopolamine. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is considered an experimental model organism with numerous applications in different fields. The mechanisms underlying social and reproductive preferences are complex. Most of the literature on conspecific interactions focus on the chemical communication mediated by scattered signals in the aquatic medium. The aim of this research was to evaluate the behavioral responses induced in the tested animals by artificial social stimuli. We used 20 sexually mature individuals that underwent several non-invasive behavioral tests in a cross-maze. Artificial non-moving 2D images were created for this study, using photoshop graphics software. Ethological measurements were conducted using video-tracking software (EthoVision XT). The findings showed significant sex-related differences in zebrafish responses to fixed artificial stimuli. In particular, females shoaled more with 2D non-moving images representing conspecifics phenotypically more distant (i.e. color) from them. Integrating dimension and number of individual, one large stimulus was preferred over three small stimuli in terms of cumulative and mean duration for males, and only in terms of cumulative duration for females. We concluded that 2D images representing conspecifics, even without movements, can induce a behavioral response in this species. © 2020 by the Serbian Biological Society.

AB  - Attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) is the most common psychiatric disorder in children affecting around 11% of children 4–17 years of age (CDC 2019). Children with ADHD are widely treated with stimulant medications such as methylphenidate (Ritalin®). However, there has been little research on the developmental effects of methylphenidate on risk-taking and sociability. We investigated in zebrafish the potential developmental neurobehavioral toxicity of methylphenidate on these behavioral functions. We chose zebrafish because they provide a model with extensive genetic tools for future mechanistic studies. We studied whether sub-chronic methylphenidate exposure during juvenile development causes neurobehavioral impairments in zebrafish. Methylphenidate diminished responses to environmental stimuli after both acute and sub-chronic dosing. In adult zebrafish, acute methylphenidate impaired avoidance of an approaching visual stimulus modeling a predator and decreased locomotor response to the social visual stimulus of conspecifics. Adult zebrafish dosed acutely with methylphenidate demonstrated behaviors of less retreat from threatening visual stimuli and less approach to conspecifics compared with controls. In a sub-chronic dosing paradigm during development, methylphenidate caused less robust exploration of a novel tank. In the predator avoidance paradigm, sub-chronic dosing that began at an older age (28 dpf) decreased activity levels more than sub-chronic dosing that began at earlier ages (14 dpf and 21 dpf). In the social shoaling task, sub-chronic methylphenidate attenuated reaction to the social stimulus. Acute and developmental methylphenidate exposure decreased response to environmental cues. Additional research is needed to determine critical mechanisms for these effects and to see how these results may be translatable to neurobehavioral toxicity of prescribing Ritalin® to children and adolescents. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Impairment in glucose regulation is an indicatory effect capable of mediating multiple dysfunction such as cerebrovascular disorder with ischemia and brain damage inclusive. This study aims at investigating the glucose-lowering and neuroprotective capability of Diosgenin (DG) towards hyperglycemia-induced cerebral injury in a developed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) Zebrafish (ZF) model. T2DM was developed in ZF with 20 mg/kg body weight (b.w) multiple-low dose (MLD) Streptozotocin (STZ) for 28 days. Different doses of 20 mg/kg b.w (DG1) and 40 mg/kg b.w (DG2) DG was intraperitoneally administered twice in 7 days for a period of 28 days after T2DM was completely developed. Weight and behavioral changes were monitored and the catalytic activity including the plasma glucose level of diseased and treated ZF was spectrometrically estimated. Histopathological studies were employed to image the brain pathological condition during disease and treatment. SPSS was used as the statistical tool for result analysis and comparison of data obtained. STZ significantly (###p &lt; 0.001) induced hyperglycemia when compared to control as plasma glucose increases from 101.56 ± 4.52 mgdL−1 to 175.87 ± 6.00 mg/dL. Our results have indicated a marked reduction in glucose concentration from a mean average of 175.87 ± 6.00 mgdL−1 to 105.68 ± 4.48 mgdL−1 and 82.06 ± 7.27 mgdL−1 in DG 1 and DG 2 respectively. Catalytic activity significantly decreases (p &lt; 0.05) from 206.42 ± 30.77 unit/mL to 123.85 ± 29.99 unit/mL at a minimum and maximum value of 103.21 and 275.23 in diseased ZF respectively. On DG treatment, catalytic activity significantly (p &lt; 0.01) rise from 101.58 ± 11.29 and 130.73 ± 27.52 to 130.98 ± 17.13 and 255.96 ± 30.34 with DG1 and DG2 treatment respectively. Studies on the behavioral pattern of STZ-induced anxiolytic effect on ZF confirmed changes in the number of transitions and time spent in both Novel tank test (NTT) and Dark/light test (LDT). Histopathological analysis confirmed the cerebral cortex with inflammatory brain cells in the diseased condition and an attenuation of damage posed revealed in diseased state was largely reversed with DG. As compared to the normal control, a significant (#p &lt; 0.05 and ###p &lt; 0.001) changes in weight of fishes were recorded and DG1 and DG2 significantly promotes (***p &lt; 0.001) body weight and improves the irregularities in weight of ZF during disease progression. Our study confirms that the potential of DG towards the management of hyperglycemia and hyperglycemia–mediated cerebral ischemic injury is through its blood glucose-lowering properties, anti-inflammatory activity, antioxidant effect, and anxiolytic capabilities. © 2020

AB  - Current theories on the role of serotonin (5-HT) in vertebrate defensive behavior suggest that this monoamine increases anxiety but decreases fear, by acting at different levels of the neuroaxis. This paradoxical, dual role of 5-HT suggests that a serotonergic tone inhibits fear responses, while an acute increase in 5-HT would produce anxiety-like behavior. However, so far no evidence for a serotonergic tone has been found. Using zebrafish alarm responses, we investigate the participation of phasic and tonic 5-HT levels in fear-like behavior, as well as in behavior after stimulation. Conspecific alarm substance (CAS) increased bottom-dwelling and erratic swimming, and animals transferred to a novel environment after CAS exposure (post-exposure behavior) showed increased bottom-dwelling and freezing. Clonazepam blocked CAS effects during and after exposure. Acute fluoxetine dose-dependently decreased fear-like behavior, but increased post-exposure freezing. Metergoline had no effect on fear-like behavior, but blocked the effects of CAS on post-exposure behavior; similar effects were observed with para-chlorophenylalanine. Finally, CAS was shown to decrease the activity of monoamine oxidase in the zebrafish brain after exposure. These results suggest that phasic and tonic serotonin encode an aversive expectation value, switching behavior toward cautious exploration/risk assessment/anxiety when the aversive stimulus is no longer present.

AB  - Epilepsy is a debilitating neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. Anxiety, cognitive deficits, depressive-like symptoms, and social dysfunction are psychiatric comorbidities with high prevalence in epileptic patients. Due to the genetic and behavioral tractability, the zebrafish is a promising model organism to understand the neural bases involved in epilepsy-related comorbidities. Here, we aimed to characterize some behavioral phenotypes paralleling those observed in epilepsy-related comorbidities after a single pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) exposure in zebrafish. We also analyzed the influence of whole-body cortisol levels in the behavioral responses measured. Fish were exposed to 10 mM PTZ for 20 min to induce epileptic seizures. After 24 h recovery period, locomotion and anxiety-like responses (novel tank and light-dark tests), social interaction (shoaling behavior task), and memory retention (inhibitory avoidance protocol) were assessed. Basically, PTZ impaired habituation to novelty stress, evoked anxiogenic-like behaviors, disrupted shoaling, and caused memory consolidation deficits in zebrafish without changing whole-body cortisol levels. In conclusion, our novel findings further validate the use of zebrafish as a suitable tool for modeling epilepsy-related comorbidities in translational neuropsychiatric research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An unhealthy diet with excessive fat intake has often been claimed to induce not only obesity but also cognitive dysfunction in mammals; however, it is not known whether this is the case in zebrafish. Here, we investigated the effect of excessive fat in the diet on cognitive function and on gene expression in the telencephalon of zebrafish. Cognitive function, as measured by active avoidance test, was impaired by feeding of a high-fat diet compared with a control diet. In RNA sequencing analysis of the telencephalon, 97 genes were identified with a fold change in expression greater than 2 and a p-value less than 0.05 between the two diets. In quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the telencephalon, genes related to neuronal activity, anti-oxidative stress, blood–brain barrier function and amyloid-β degradation were found to be downregulated, whereas genes related to apoptosis and amyloid-β production were found to be upregulated, in the high-fat diet group, which are changes known to occur in mammals fed a high-fat diet. Collectively, these results are similar to those found in mammals, suggesting that zebrafish can serve as a suitable animal model in research into cognitive impairment induced by excessive fat in the diet. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Differences in selection pressure in nature and labs have profound effects on zebrafish strains. The widely used AB strain of zebrafish has been domesticated over several decades. Recently, there has been an upsurge in the availability of genetically modified lines, e.g., the spiegeldanio (spd), which has a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1a (fgfr1a) gene. This mutant strain (fgfr1a) has previously been reported to be bolder than fish of the Tübingen strain, from which it was generated. Our knowledge on behavioral differences between different zebrafish strains, relative to wild-caught zebrafish, is limited. In the present study we compare behaviors related to interpretation of boldness in male and female offspring (F1) of wild-caught fish, AB and fgfr1a−/− zebrafish. A second aim of the study was to compare the behavior of fish from these strains when tested in different behavioral assays, i.e., shelter seeking, novel tank diving and scototaxis tests. The results demonstrate that behavioral variation exists both within and between the strains, but interpretation of boldness reveals a complex pattern in which behavior differs between strains but is also related to sex and test. Therefore, a careful assessment of various strains of fish using both males and females is warranted in order to strengthen interpretation of results. This is especially important in studies where zebrafish are used as model organisms for human conditions as well as studies evaluating the effects of pharmacological or toxicological substances on behavior. © Copyright © 2019 Mustafa, Roman and Winberg.

AB  - Chemical exposure during the early life stages of development may have long lasting effects on organisms that are rarely studied. The present work intended to evaluate the effect of embryonic exposure to the pesticide carbaryl on adult fish behavior. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed, for 4 days, to sublethal concentrations of carbaryl (0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/L) plus a control and then kept in standard cultivation conditions until adulthood. A battery of behavioral tests was then performed to assess anxiety-like behavior (locomotor activity, thigmotaxis and novel tank diving test), social behavior, and feeding. Developmental exposure of zebrafish to sublethal concentrations of carbaryl produced important behavioral alterations in the adulthood. Main effects included decreased locomotion/hypoactivity (increase in slow movements and decrease of medium and rapid movements), especially in the light periods. Moreover, spatial pattern also changed: while during dark periods control fish increased activity in the outer zone of the tank, this was not observed in exposed fish. Overall, this demonstrated the importance of life stage exposure, clearly demonstrating long lasting effects of a (chemical) stress event at embryonic stages. This data supports the need of considering this scenario in environmental risk evaluations. Further work should focus on the mechanistic effects of developmental disruption responsible for the effects observed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Venlafaxine (VEN) is one of the first clinical drugs for the treatment of depression. Long-term use may cause a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome. Melatonin (MT) could ameliorate depression behavior. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the antidepressant effects of venlafaxine in combination with melatonin on zebrafish. Reserpine was used to induce depression-like behavioral zebrafish. To explore the effects of combined use of venlafaxine and melatonin on depression-like zebrafish induced by reserpine. We tested the depressive behavior of adult zebrafish through a novel tank test, and evaluated the levels of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) in zebrafish brain using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), besides that the gene expression of serotonin transporters a (serta), dopamine transporters (dat) and norepinephrine transporters (net), vesicular monoamine transporter2 (vmat2) and monoamine oxidase (mao) were evaluated by qRT-PCR. The results showed that, compared with reserpine-only group, venlafaxine (VEN, 0.025 mg/L) and melatonin (MT, 1 μM) increased the parameters of exploration in the top of the tank and decreased freezing behavior significantly. Compared with reserpine-only group, the use of VEN combined with MT increased serotonin and norepinephrine levels significantly, while there was no obvious difference in dopamine content. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the use of VEN combined with MT significantly reduced the expression of serta and promoted the expression of vmat2, but had no significant effect on the expression of net, dat and mao. The results indicated that venlafaxine combined with melatonin showed more effective role to remedy the depressive symptoms in zebrafish, providing a reference for the clinical application of antidepressants. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The two-factor theory predicts that the acquisition of avoidance responses is dependent on fear reduction; as such, drugs that reduce or increase fear or anxiety states should alter inhibitory avoidance (IA) acquisition. The present experiment used white spaces as aversive unconditioned stimuli in IA in zebrafish. Adult zebrafishes were tested in three experiments: validation of white compartment as aversive in IA; open field test; and effect of antidepressant (fluoxetine, imipramine) and anxiolytic (diazepam, clonazepam). The data show the effectiveness of the white compartment as an aversive stimulus in IA. Antidepressant fluoxetine did not alter and imipramine impairs avoidance acquisition in higher doses. Imipramine also produced a sedative effect in lower doses. Anxiolytic and stimulant drugs facilitated learning at doses which did not impair locomotion, suggesting that pharmacological manipulation of other factors in addition to fear/anxiety can impact aversive learning in zebrafish. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.

AB  - Reelin (Reln) is an extracellular glycoprotein that is important for brain patterning. During development Reln coordinates the radial migration of postmitotic cortical neurons, cerebellar and hippocampal neurons, whereas it promotes dendrite maturation, synaptogenesis, synaptic transmission, plasticity and neurotransmitter release in the postnatal and adult brain. Genetic studies of human patients have demonstrated association between the RELN locus and autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer’s disease. In this study we have characterized the behavioral phenotype of reelin (reln) mutant zebrafish, as well as two canonical signaling pathway targets DAB adaptor protein 1a (dab1a) and the very low density lipoprotein receptor (vldlr). Zebrafish reln–/– mutants display a selective reduction in preference for social novelty that is not observed in dab1a–/– or vldlr–/– mutant lines. They also exhibit an increase in 5-HT signaling in the hindbrain that parallels but does not underpin the alteration in social preference. These results suggest that zebrafish reln–/– mutants can be used to model some aspects of human diseases in which changes to Reln signaling alter social behavior. © Copyright © 2019 Dalla Vecchia, Di Donato, Young, Del Bene and Norton.

AB  - Background: Identifying chemicals with narcotic potency is an important aspect of assessing the safety of consumer products that may be accidentally ingested. A rapid and efficient assay of narcotic potency is desired for assessing chemicals with such suspected activity. Objectives: This purpose of this research was to develop a non-mammalian vertebrate, high throughput, neurobehavioral method to assess the narcotic potency of chemicals using larval zebrafish. Methods: Larval zebrafish were acutely exposed to chemicals beginning at 5 days post fertilization (5 dpf). Locomotor activity, elicited by regular, periodic photostimulation, was quantified using a video tracking apparatus. Narcotic potency was determined as the molar concentration at which photostimulated locomotor activity was reduced by 50% (IC50). Toxicity was assessed based on observations of morbidity or mortality. Recovery was assessed following removal of test material by serial dilution and reassessment of photostimulated behavior 24 hr later (6 dpf). Results: A total of 21 chemicals were assessed. Etomidate, a human narcotic analgesic agent, was used as a reference material. Investigating a series of eleven linear, primary alcohols (C6 to C16), a relationship between narcotic potency and carbon number was observed; narcotic potency increased with carbon number up to C12, consistent with historical studies. For a set of technical grade surfactants, nonionic surfactants (i.e., alcohol ethoxylates)were observed to be narcotic agents while anionic surfactants produced evidence of reduced locomotor activity only in combination with toxicity. Of the solvents evaluated, only ethanol exhibited narcotic activity with an IC50 of 261 mM and was the least potent of the chemicals investigated. Etomidate was the most potent material evaluated with an IC50 of 0.39 μM. Conclusions: The larval zebrafish neurobehavioral assay provides a method capable of estimating the narcotic potency of chemicals and can identify if toxicity contributes to observed neurobehavioral effects in the test organism. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anxiety-related disorders are severe psychiatric conditions that involve complex physiological and behavioral maladaptive responses. The use of conspecific alarm substance (CAS) for inducing anxiety-like behaviors in fish species provides important translational insights of how aversive conditions modulate neurobehavioral functions. Because nicotine may elicit anxiolytic-like responses, here we investigated whether acute nicotine exposure prevents CAS-induced anxiogenic-like behaviors in zebrafish. We used both novel tank and light-dark tests as two well-established paradigms for measuring anxiety-like phenotypes. Fish were individually exposed to 1 mg/L nicotine or non-chlorinated water for 3 min and then transferred to other tanks in the absence or presence of 3.5 mL/L CAS for 5 min. Later, the behavior of fish was tested in the novel tank test or in the light-dark preference test. As expected, CAS triggered aversive behaviors by increasing bottom-dwelling, freezing, erratic movements, scototaxis, and risk assessment episodes. Nicotine alone elicited anxiolytic-like behaviors since it increased the time spent in the top, as well as the average duration of entry in the lit compartment. Moreover, nicotine pretreatment prevented CAS-induced aversive responses without changing locomotion, suggesting that anxiolysis could play a role, at least in part, to the behavioral effects of nicotine observed here. Overall, these novel findings show the beneficial effects of nicotine on anxiogenic responses in zebrafish. We also reinforce the practical advantages of this aquatic species to explore the relieving properties of nicotine, as well as to understand the neurobiological bases involved in anxiety-related disorders and associated therapeutic targets. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - New environments are known to be anxiogenic initially for many animals including the zebrafish. In the zebrafish, a novel tank diving (NTD) assay for solitary fish has been used extensively to model anxiety and the effect of anxiolytics. However, studies can differ in the conditions used to perform this assay. Here, we report the development of an efficient, automated toolset and optimal conditions for effective use of this assay. Applying these tools, we found that two important variables in previous studies, the direction of illumination of the novel tank and the age of the subject fish, both influence endpoints commonly measured to assess anxiety. When tanks are illuminated from underneath, several parameters such as the time spent at the bottom of the tank, or the transitions to the top half of the tank become poor measures of acclimation to the novel environment. Older fish acclimate faster to the same settings. The size of the novel tank and the intensity of the illuminating light can also influence acclimation. Among the parameters measured, reduction in the frequency of erratic swimming (darting) is the most reliable indicator of anxiolysis. Open source pipeline for automated data acquisition and systematic analysis generated here and available to other researchers will improve accessibility and uniformity in measurements. They can also be directly applied to study other fish. As this assay is commonly used to model anxiety phenotype of neuropsychiatric ailments in zebrafish, we expect our tools will further aid comparative and meta-analyses. © Copyright © 2019 Haghani, Karia, Cheng and Mathuru.

AB  - The object discrimination test allows the testing of different memory retention periods. However, few behavioral endpoints have been measured in fish species such that retention is often assessed using a single parameter (time spent in object area). Here, we aimed to explore the object discrimination test in zebrafish by assessing their behavioral performance after 1 or 24 h retention interval periods. To characterize putative interaction-like behaviors, fish were tested in the absence or presence of scopolamine (1 h before test session). Zebrafish were habituated for 3 consecutive days in the experimental tank, and training session was performed for 10 min using two identical nonpreferred objects (black cube or sphere). After the retention intervals, a familiar object was replaced by a novel object (test session, 10 min). Fish were also exposed to the novel tank diving test to assess locomotion and anxiety-like behaviors. At 1 h retention interval, animals performed more circular-like investigation near the familiar object, whereas 24 h after training session, a prominent rapid investigation was observed when animals explore the nonfamiliar object. Because scopolamine abolished these phenotypes, as well as the increased time spent in the novel object area during the test without changing locomotion and anxiety-related parameters, the behavioral responses described here may predictively reflect interaction-like behaviors involved in object discrimination memory in zebrafish models. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.

AB  - Water temperature is an important environmental parameter influencing the distribution and the health of fishes and it plays a central role in ectothermic animals. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of environmental temperature on the brain proteome and the behavioural responses in zebrafish, a widely used animal model for environmental “omics” studies. Adult specimens of wild-type zebrafish were kept at 18 °C, 34 °C and 26 °C (control) for 21 days. Proteomic data revealed that several proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization, mitochondrial regulation and energy metabolism are differently regulated at the extreme temperatures. In particular, the expression of proteins associated to synapses and neurotransmitter release is down-regulated at 18 °C and 34 °C. In both thermal conditions, fish exhibited a reduced interest for the novel environment and an impairment of cognitive abilities during Y-Maze behavioural tests. The observed pathways of protein expression are possibly associated to functional alterations of the synaptic transmission that may result in cognitive functions impairment at central nervous system level as those revealed by behavioural tests. This study indicates that temperature variations can elicit biochemical changes that may affect fish health and behaviour. This combined approach provides insights into mechanisms supporting thermal acclimation and plasticity in fishes. Significance: Environmental temperature variation may impact on all levels of biological life. Understanding the impact of thermal variation on the nervous system and animal behaviour is of primary importance since the results obtained can be applied from the ecological to the biomedical fields. © 2019

AB  - Adult zebrafish, in contrast to mammals, regenerate neurons in their brain, but the extent and variability of this capacity is unclear. Here we ask whether the loss of various dopaminergic neuron populations is sufficient to trigger their functional regeneration. Both sexes of zebrafish were analyzed. Genetic lineage tracing shows that specific diencephalic ependymo-radial glial (ERG) progenitor cells give rise to new dopaminergic [tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+)] neurons. Ablation elicits an immune response, increased proliferation of ERG progenitor cells, and increased addition of new TH+ neurons in populations that constitutively add new neurons (e.g., diencephalic population 5/6). Inhibiting theimmuneresponse attenuates neurogenesis to control levels. Boosting theimmuneresponse enhancesERG proliferation, but not addition of TH+ neurons. In contrast, in populations in which constitutive neurogenesis is undetectable (e.g., the posterior tuberculum and locus ceruleus), cell replacement and tissue integration are incomplete and transient. This is associated with a loss of spinal TH+ axons, as well as permanent deficits in shoaling and reproductive behavior. Hence, dopaminergic neuron populations in the adult zebrafish brain show vast differences in regenerative capacity that correlate with constitutive addition of neurons and depend on immune system activation. © 2019 the authors.

AB  - Triadimefon (TDF) is a triazole fungicide extensively used in agriculture that has been found as a pollutant in numerous water sources. In mammals, it inhibits monoamine uptake through binding to the dopamine transporter, with a mechanism of action similar to cocaine, resulting in higher levels of dopamine at the synapse. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in a broad spectrum of processes such as locomotion, cognition, reward, and mental disorders. In this work we have studied, for the first time, the effects of TDF on behavior of both larval and adult zebrafish and its connection with changes in the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. We evaluated the acute exposure of 5 dpf larvae to different concentrations of TDF, ranging from 5 mg/L to 35 mg/L. The lowest concentration does not alter neither locomotor activity nor dopamine levels but produced changes in the expression of two genes, tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) and dopamine transporter (dat). Besides, it induced a reduction in extracellular serotonin and had an anxiolytic-like effect, supported by a decrease in cortisol production. On the other hand, a high concentration of TDF produced a dose-dependent reduction in locomotion, which was reversed or enhanced by D1 (SCH-23390) or D2 (Haloperidol) dopamine receptor antagonists, respectively. Using in vivo electrochemistry, we show that these changes could be associated with higher levels of dopamine in the brain. Thus, in adult zebrafish, though not in larvae, TDF exposure increases locomotor activity, anxiety and aggressiveness, which coincides with the behaviors observed in mammals. © 2018

AB  - Pharmacological agents acting at alpha-2 adrenergic receptors are widely used in physiology and neuroscience research. Mounting evidence of their potential utility in clinical and experimental psychopharmacology, necessitates new models and novel model organisms for their screening. Here, we characterize behavioral effects of mafedine (6-oxo-1-phenyl-2- (phenylamino)-1,6-dihydropyrimidine-4-sodium olate), a novel drug with alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonistic effects, in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in the novel tank test of anxiety and activity. Following an acute 20-min exposure, mafedine at 60 mg/L produced a mild psychostimulant action with some anxiogenic-like effects. Repeated acute 20-min/day administration of mafedine for 7 consecutive days at 1, 5 and 10 mg/L had a similar action on fish behavior as an acute exposure to 60 mg/L. Since mafedine demonstrated robust behavioral effects in zebrafish – a sensitive vertebrate aquatic model, it is likely that it may modulate rodent and human behavior as well. Thus, further studies are needed to explore this possibility in detail, and whether it may foster clinical application of mafedine and related alpha-2 adrenergic agents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of two citrus flavonoids, hesperidin and naringin, on alcohol-induced thigmotaxis behavioural and developmental defects in zebrafish. The results of behavioural assays indicated that acute exposure to 1% alcohol could induce thigmotaxis behaviour in zebrafish larvae at 3 and 5 days post-fertilization (dpf), whereas hesperidin and naringin could inhibit the thigmotaxis behaviour in zebrafish larvae. Moreover, developmental administration of hesperidin and naringin reduced the levels of morphological defects and apoptosis induced by developmental alcohol exposure. In conclusion, this study suggests that the citrus flavonoids hesperidin and naringin could reduce the effects of alcohol damage on embryonic development and neurobehaviour in zebrafish larvae, which would provide useful knowledge for assessing the underlying mechanism of citrus flavonoids and their protective effects. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Oxine-copper (OxCu) is generally used as an agricultural pesticide and induces harmful effects on ecosystems. In this study, zebrafish was used to assess the aquatic toxicity of OxCu. To detect the effects on development, embryos of 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to 10 μg/L, 20 μg/L, 40 μg/L OxCu for 18 h; meanwhile, to evaluate the effects on the behavior, larval fish at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed to the same concentrations for 24 h. Here, we show that there are embryonic developmental defects, including abnormalities of head and trunk, brain ventricle atrophy, reduced newborn neurons, disordered neurons, increased intercellular space, concentrated cytoplasm, decreased heart beat and blood flow velocity, and developmental delay of the vascular system; in addition, some embryos exposed to the high concentration of OxCu degraded from the tail. We also found that the spontaneous tail coiling frequency and AChE enzyme activity were reduced, while oxidative stress (free radical damage) and cell apoptosis were significantly increased. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in neurodevelopment, vascular development and apoptosis were dysregulated in the OxCu exposed embryos in a concentration-dependent manner. Finally, we found that after exposure to OxCu, larval locomotor activity was decreased and accompanied by Parkinson-like (increased absolute turn angle and sinuosity) and anxiety-like (preferred to the central area) behavior. These results indicate that OxCu induces developmental toxicity and behavioral alterations by affecting AChE enzyme activity and oxidative stress. Our data present new proofs of OxCu toxicity and a warning for its application. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Responding appropriately to stressful stimuli is essential for survival of an organism. Extensive research has been done on a wide spectrum of stress-related diseases and psychiatric disorders, yet further studies into the genetic and neuronal regulation of stress are still required to develop better therapeutics. The zebrafish provides a powerful genetic model to investigate the neural underpinnings of stress, as there exists a large collection of mutant and transgenic lines. Moreover, pharmacology can easily be applied to zebrafish, as most drugs can be added directly to water. We describe here the use of the ŉovel tank test’ as a method to study innate stress responses in zebrafish, and demonstrate how potential anxiolytic drugs can be validated using the assay. The method can easily be coupled with zebrafish lines harboring genetic mutations, or those in which transgenic approaches for manipulating precise neural circuits are used. The assay can also be used in other fish models. Together, the described protocol should facilitate the adoption of this simple assay to other laboratories. © 2019 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

AB  - The light-dark preference task has been commonly used in rodents to screen for anxiogenic and anxiolytic drugs. However, recent adaptations of the light-dark preference test for zebrafish have produced inconsistent results. Several studies have reported that zebrafish exhibit a preference for light, while others have found a preference for black. We suggest the inconsistencies may be the result of confusing certain parameters of the test leading to improper interpretation. For example, researchers often use “light” interchangeably with “white” and “dark” with “black” when these are two distinct factors: level of illumination vs. background shade. In the current study, we use specifically designed preference tanks to investigate the influence of background shade (i.e. white vs. black) and level of illumination (i.e. light vs. dark) on preference and anxiety-like behaviour. Furthermore, we pharmacologically validate our results by quantifying the effects of ethanol, a drug with known anxiety-altering properties, on anxiety-like behaviours. Here we report that zebrafish's preference varies depending upon background shade and level of illumination. We also found that ethanol administration altered behavioural responses in an illumination- and background shade-dependent manner. Our findings reinforce the need to correctly differentiate between these factors when interpreting results obtained with this behavioural paradigm. Lastly, our results show that simple modifications to the experimental tank in which anxiety-related responses are measured can significantly alter behaviour of zebrafish, supporting the need for standardized testing procedures and/or for detailed description of experimental procedures and the apparatus. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To orient themselves in their environment, animals integrate a wide array of external cues, which interact with several internal factors, such as personality. Here, we describe a behavioral protocol designed for the study of the influence of zebrafish personality on their orientation response to multiple external environmental cues, specifically water currents and magnetic fields. This protocol aims to understand whether proactive or reactive zebrafish display different rheotactic thresholds (i.e., the flow speed at which the fish start swimming upstream) when the surrounding magnetic field changes its direction. To identify zebrafish with the same personality, fish are introduced in the dark half of a tank connected with a narrow opening to a bright half. Only proactive fish explore the novel, bright environment. Reactive fish do not exit the dark half of the tank. A swimming tunnel with low flow rates is used to determine the rheotactic threshold. We describe two setups to control the magnetic field in the tunnel, in the range of the earth's magnetic field intensity: one that controls the magnetic field along the flow direction (one dimension) and one that allows a three-axial control of the magnetic field. Fish are filmed while experiencing a stepwise increase of the flow speed in the tunnel under different magnetic fields. Data on the orientation behavior are collected through a video-tracking procedure and applied to a logistic model to allow the determination of the rheotactic threshold. We report representative results collected from shoaling zebrafish. Specifically, these demonstrate that only reactive, prudent fish show variations of the rheotactic threshold when the magnetic field varies in its direction, while proactive fish do not respond to magnetic field changes. This methodology can be applied to the study of magnetic sensitivity and rheotactic behavior of many aquatic species, both displaying solitary or shoaling swimming strategies.

AB  - The three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a small teleost fish that is ubiquitous across the Northern Hemisphere. Among the behaviours that have been characterised in this species is ritualized courtship, aggressiveness and parental behaviour. Whereas three-spined sticklebacks have been used for ecological, evolutionary, parasitological and toxicological research, its complex behavioural repertoire and experimental advantages have not been exploited for basic neuroscience research. The aim of the present study is to describe some innate behaviours of laboratory bred three-spined sticklebacks by using a battery of tests that have been developed and validated to model some aspects of human psychiatric disorders in zebrafish. We recorded mirror induced aggression, novel object boldness, shoaling, and anxiety-like behaviour using both the novel tank diving and the black-white preference tests. We show that behaviour of three-spined sticklebacks in these standard tests is remarkably similar to that of zebrafish and other species and can be altered by fluoxetine and buspirone. These findings highlight the potential of using three-spined sticklebacks for cross-species and translational studies. © 2019 Norton, Gutiérrez.

AB  - The sequencing of the zebrafish genome, the emergence of powerful gene-editing tools, and the development of in vivo imaging techniques have propelled the economical zebrafish into prominence as a biomedical research model. Neurodegenerative disorders with a cholinergic component, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, are currently modeled using zebrafish. Still, the utility of zebrafish as a research model will not be fully realized until their neurophysiological properties are thoroughly characterized. In mammals, the coupling of cholinergic receptors to the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 β (GSK3β) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) is of critical importance to cognitive processes and imparts protection against neuropathogenic events. Similarly, it is known that cholinergic receptors are required for learning and memory in zebrafish and that in vivo activation of cholinergic receptors induces transient changes in evoked synaptic transmission in the telencephalon. However, the intracellular events mediating cholinergic processes in zebrafish have yet to be elucidated. In the current study, an ex vivo drug treatment assay was used to demonstrate that carbachol (CCh)-mediated cholinergic stimulation of the intact adult zebrafish brain induces phosphorylation of GSK3β and ERK1/2 in the zebrafish telencephalon. These findings suggest GSK3β and ERK1/2 may underly cognitive processes in zebrafish. © 2019 Mans, Hinton, Payne, Powers, Scheuermann and Saint-Jean.

AB  - While Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has been widely studied in the realm of developmental and reproductive toxicology, few studies have investigated potential toxicities from a second widely used cannabis constituent, cannabidiol (CBD). CBD is popularized for its therapeutic potential for reducing seizure frequencies in epilepsy. This study investigated developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) via multigenerational gene expression patterns, behavior phenotypes, and reproductive fitness of a subsequent F1 following an F0 developmental exposure of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to THC (0.024, 0.12, 0.6 mg/L; 0.08, 0.4, 2 μM) or CBD (0.006, 0.03, 0.15 mg/L; 0.02, 0.1, 0.5 μM). Embryonic exposure at these concentrations did not cause notable morphological abnormalities in either F0 or F1 generations. However, during key developmental stages (14, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post fertilization) THC and CBD caused differential expression of c-fos, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), and deleted-in-azoospermia like (dazl), while in F1 larvae only CBD differentially expressed dazl. Larval photomotor behavior was reduced (F0) or increased (F1) by THC exposure, while CBD had no effect on F0 larvae, but decreased activity in the unexposed F1 larvae. These results support our hypothesis of cannabinoid-related developmental neurotoxicity. As adults, F0 fecundity was reduced, but it was not in F1 adults. Conversely, in the adult open field test there were no significant effects in F0 fish, but a significant reduction in the time in periphery was seen in F1 fish from the highest THC exposure group. The results highlight the need to consider long-term ramifications of early-life exposure to cannabinoids. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Atropine and scopolamine are classical muscarinic cholinergic antagonists that exert multiple CNS effects. Belonging to a group of deliriant hallucinogens, these drugs induce delirium-like hallucinations, hyperactivity, altered affective states and amnesia. However, as deliriants remain the least studied group of hallucinogens, their complex and poorly understood profiles necessitate further clinical and preclinical studies. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is rapidly emerging as a powerful model organism for translational neuropsychopharmacology research. Here, we characterize acute behavioral effects of atropine (60, 90 and 120 mg/L) and scopolamine (60, 120, 180 and 240 mg/L) in adult zebrafish subjected to the novel tank (NTT), light-dark (LDT) and shoaling tests. Overall, atropine at 90 mg/L only mildly increased the NTT locomotor activity, scopolamine at 120 mg/L produced anxiogenic-like NTT effects without affecting other behaviors, and both drugs similarly disrupted zebrafish group behavior in the shoaling test. Collectively, this supports complex and partially overlapping deliriant-like effects of acute atropine and scopolamine in zebrafish. The behavioral sensitivity to these drugs suggests zebrafish as potential screens for cholinergic deliriant psychotropic agents, also necessitating further cross-species in-vivo experimental studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Individual variation in coping with environmental challenges is a well-known phenomenon across vertebrates, including teleost fish. Dopamine is the major transmitter in the brain reward networks, and important for motivational processes and stress coping. Functions of the endogenous opioid system are not well studied in teleosts. However, in mammals the activity in the brain reward networks is regulated by the endogenous opioid system. This study aimed at investigating if there was a correlation between risk-taking behavior and the expression of dopamine and opioid receptors in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain. Risk-taking behavior was assessed in a novel tank diving test, and the most extreme high risk taking, i.e. bold, and low risk taking, i.e. shy, fish were sampled for qPCR analysis of whole brain gene expression. The expression analysis showed a significantly higher expression of the dopamine D2 receptors (drd2a and drd2b) and the delta opioid receptor (DOR; oprd1b) in bold compared to shy fish. Besides reward and reinforcing properties, DORs are also involved in emotional responses. Dopamine D2 receptors are believed to be important for active stress coping in rodents, and taken together the results of the current study suggest similar functions in zebrafish. However, additional experiments are required to clarify how dopamine and opioid receptor activation affect behavior and stress coping in this species. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Background: The startle response, pre-pulse presentation of startle, and habituation in adult zebrafish (danio rerio) have not been formerly characterized using the same motion detection equipment within an integrated procedure. New method: The methods presented in this manuscript describe the use of a video tracking software used previously in the detection of conditioned immobility in rodents, but adapted for the purposes of tracking zebrafish movement. Results: The results from a series of investigations demonstrate an effective tracking and quantification of the startle response, as well as evidence that stimulus-experience history alters the startle response in adult zebrafish. Comparison with existing methods: This method of tracking zebrafish allows for the quantification on movement of a single subject, and the delivery of the startle stimulus can be synchronized with the motion-detection software to obtain a high temporal resolution that is not provided by other means of motion-detection tracking. Conclusion: Objective techniques for evaluating these basic modifications of the startle response (pre-pulse and habituation) may be helpful in future behavioral analysis as this species is rapidly becoming among the most commonly utilized in preclinical pharmacological assessment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pain, a severely debilitating symptom of many human disorders, is a growing, unmet biomedical problem. Although the use of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate both behavioral and physiological nociception-related responses is expanding rapidly, the characterization of behavioral phenotypes that reflect injury location is limited, making the results of such studies difficult to interpret. Here, we characterize putative nociception-related behavioral phenotypes in adult zebrafish following an intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of acetic acid, a well-established protocol for visceral pain in rodents. Acetic acid (2.5 and 5.0%) induced an abdominal constriction-like response, which was assessed by measuring a body curvature index. Moreover, all doses tested (0.5–5.0%) reduced distance traveled and vertical activity in the novel tank test. Freezing duration increased following 5.0% acetic acid, whereas fish injected with 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0% spent more time in top area of the tank. Both morphine (an opioid analgesic) and diclofenac (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, NSAID) prevented the 5.0% acetic acid-induced changes in body curvature index, whereas naloxone blocked these effects of morphine. Overall, zebrafish exposed to a single acetic acid i.p. injection display abnormal body curvature and specific changes in behavioral parameters sensitive to anti-nociceptive pharmacological modulation. We suggest that the abdominal constriction-like response represents a novel specific nociceptive-related phenotype in zebrafish. In general, our findings support the growing utility of zebrafish in translational pain research and antinociceptive drug discovery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There is accumulating evidence on the use of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in the treatment of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. As a multi-target drug and a glutathione precursor, NAC is a promising molecule in the management of stress-related disorders, for which there is an expanding field of research investigating novel therapies targeting oxidative pathways. The deleterious effects of chronic stress in the central nervous system are a result of glutamatergic hyperactivation, glutathione (GSH) depletion, oxidative stress, and increased inflammatory response, among others. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of NAC in zebrafish submitted to unpredictable chronic stress (UCS). Animals were initially stressed or not for 7 days, followed by treatment with NAC (1 mg/L, 10 min) or vehicle for 7 days. UCS decreased the number of entries and time spent in the top area in the novel tank test, which indicate increased anxiety levels. It also increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and lipid peroxidation (TBARS) while decreased non-protein thiols (NPSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. NAC reversed the anxiety-like behavior and oxidative damage observed in stressed animals. Additional studies are needed to investigate the effects of this agent on glutamatergic modulation and inflammatory markers related to stress. Nevertheless, our study adds to the existing body of evidence supporting the clinical evaluation of NAC in mood disorders, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other conditions associated with stress. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Lidocaine is a voltage-gated Na+ channel blocker, commonly used as a fast-acting local and general anesthetic. Lidocaine also has central action, affecting behavior both clinically and in animal models. Adult zebrafish are rapidly becoming a critical novel model organism in translational neuroscience research. Here, we examine the effects of acute peripheral (lateral line application, 4%) and systemic (water immersion, 1, 5 and 10 mg/L) administration of lidocaine on adult zebrafish behavior tested in the novel tank test. Overall, the drug evoked hypolocomotor effect when applied systemically (at 10 mg/L) and peripherally. Peripheral lidocaine also reduced top exploration in the novel tank test (vs. sham), suggesting anxiogenic-like effect of the lateral line blockage, Our findings show the importance of the lateral line system in driving adult zebrafish locomotion, and suggest sedative-like effects of systemic lidocaine in aduld zebrafish. In addition, reflecting the role of central cholinergic contribution in lidocaine action, brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was lower following peripheral and systemic administration of lidocaine at behaviorally active doses. Collectively, our data support the effects of lidocaine on behavioral responses in zebrafish, and reinforce the growing utility of this aquatic model to screen various CNS drugs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Social behavior is a fundamental aspect of our own species, a feature without which our society would not function. There are numerous human brain disorders associated with abnormal social behavior, among them are the autism spectrum disorders whose causal factors include a genetic component. Environmental factors, including drugs of abuse such as alcohol, also contribute to numerous abnormalities related to social behavior. Several such disorders have been modeled using laboratory animals. Perhaps one of the newest among them is the zebrafish. However, the paucity of standardized behavioral assays specifically developed for the zebrafish have hindered progress. Here, we present a newly developed zebrafish behavioral paradigm, the three-chamber social choice task. This task, which was adapted from a murine model, assesses sociality and social novelty preference in zebrafish in three phases: habituation, phase-I to evaluate sociality, and phase-II to quantify social novelty preference. Test fish are placed in the middle chamber, while conspecifics are introduced to the flanking chambers during phase-I and II. Both male and female zebrafish displayed sociality (preference for conspecifics) during phase-I and social novelty preference (preference for unfamiliar conspecifics) during phase-II. We found the paradigm to be able to detect both environmentally (alcohol) as well as genetically (targeted knock out of sam2) induced alterations of behavioral phenotypes. Although ethanol-treated fish displayed similar levels of sociality to those of control (not alcohol exposed) male and female zebrafish, they were found to exhibit significantly impaired social novelty preference, a finding compatible with altered motivational or perhaps mnemonic processes. Moreover, we found that knock out of sam2, previously shown to lead to emotional dysregulation, also disrupted social novelty preference, while leaving sociality relatively intact. We conclude that our novel behavioral paradigm is appropriate for the modeling and quantification of social behavior deficits in zebrafish. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Perioperative brain ischemia and stroke are leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Brief hypoxic preconditioning is known to have protective effects against hypoxic-ischemic insult in the brain. Current studies on the neuroprotective effects of ischemic preconditioning are based on histologic findings and biomarker changes. However, studies regarding effects on memory are rare. To precondition zebrafish to hypoxia, they were exposed to a dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of 1.0 ± 0.5 mg/L in water for 30 s. The hypoxic zebrafish were then exposed to 1.0 ± 0.5 mg/L DO until the third stage of hypoxia, for 10 min ± 30 s. Zebrafish were assessed for memory retention after the hypoxic event. Learning and memory were tested using the T-maze, which evaluates memory based on whether or not zebrafish moves to the correct target compartment. In the hypoxic preconditioning group, infarct size was reduced compared with the hypoxic-only treated zebrafish group; memory was maintained to a degree similar to that in the hypoxia-untreated group. The hypoxic-only group showed significant memory impairments. In this study, we used a hypoxic zebrafish model and assessed the effects of ischemic preconditioning not only on histological damages but also on brain function, especially memory. This study demonstrated that a brief hypoxic event has protective effects in hypoxic brain damage and helped maintain memory in zebrafish. In addition, our findings suggest that the zebrafish model is useful in rapidly assessing the effects of ischemic preconditioning on memory. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are quickly becoming an important model organism in behavioural neuroscience and drug addiction research. Conditioned place preference studies show that drugs of abuse produce responses in zebrafish that are similar to mammalian animal models. Repeated administration of ethanol in zebrafish results in withdrawal-induced behavioural responses that vary with dose and exposure duration, requiring additional investigation. Here, we examine the effects of ethanol withdrawal on anxiety-like behaviours in adult zebrafish after a 21-day ethanol dosing schedule at either 0.4% or 0.8%. Anxiety-like behaviour was measured with the novel object approach test; this test involves placing a fish in a circular arena with a novel object in the centre and observing the amount of exploration of the object. We found increased anxiety-like behaviour during ethanol withdrawal. This study adds to the growing body of literature that validates the zebrafish as a model organism in the field of behavioural neuroscience and addiction. © Copyright 2019 Krook et al.

AB  - In recent years, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become a popular model to study the mechanisms of physiological and behavioral effects of stress, due to the similarity in neural structures and biochemical pathways between zebrafish and mammals. Previous research in this vertebrate animal model has demonstrated an increase in whole-body cortisol resulting from an acute (30-second) net handling stress, but it remains unclear whether such a stressor will concomitantly increase anxiety-like behavior. In addition, as the previous study examined the effects of this acute stressor in adult zebrafish after a brief period of isolation, it is unclear whether this stressor would be effective in eliciting cortisol increases in younger aged subjects without isolation. In the current study, young adult zebrafish (approximately 90 days post-fertilization) were briefly exposed to a net handling stressor and were subsequently subjected to either the novel tank test or the light/dark preference test. The novel tank test was used to measure exploration and habituation in response to a novel environment, and the light/dark preference test was used to measure locomotor activity and scototaxis behavior. All subjects were sacrificed 15 minutes post-stressor and were analyzed for whole-body levels of cortisol. Contrary to expectations, there was no effect of acute net handling on cortisol levels. Similarly, acute net handling did not significantly induce anxiety-like behavior during the novel tank test or the light/dark preference test. Our findings demonstrate that there are possible developmental differences in response to an acute net handling stress, as we did not observe alterations in hormonal or behavioral measures of anxiety in young adult zebrafish. Alternatively, if zebrafish are not isolated before the stressor, they may be more resilient to a brief acute stressor. These results suggest the need for a different or more intense acute stressor in order further explore neuroendocrine mechanisms and anxiety-like behavior at this developmental stage in the zebrafish animal model.

AB  - Exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during development may elicit long-term neuroadaptive changes that could alter the basal regulation of stress-associated physiological and behavioral processes later in life. Currently, the effects of juvenile fluoxetine exposure in rodent models appear to be dependent on the developmental window targeted as well as the duration of drug exposure. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) model is rapidly becoming a useful tool in pharmacological research and can be used to help elucidate some of the long-term effects of fluoxetine exposure prior to sexual maturation on neuroendocrine and behavioral stress markers. In the current study, juvenile zebrafish were chronically exposed to fluoxetine hydrochloride (0 or 100 mg/L) for 14 days (31-44 days post-fertilization (dpf)), then were left untreated until young adulthood. Starting at 90 dpf, basal neuroendocrine stress and behavioral responses of zebrafish were assessed. Cortisol was extracted from the young adult zebrafish body (trunk) and quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anxiety-like behaviors were assessed in response to introduction to the novel tank test. It was expected that juvenile exposure to fluoxetine would (1) reduce basal cortisol levels and (2) elicit anxiolytic effects in the novel tank test in adulthood. However, fluoxetine exposure during the juvenile period was not associated with alterations in basal levels of cortisol nor were there any significant changes in anxiety-like behavior in the young adult zebrafish. Thus, in zebrafish, it does not appear that SSRI exposure during the juvenile period has a long-term adverse or maladaptive impact on the basal expression of cortisol and anxiety-like behavior in adulthood. Further studies are needed to determine if SSRI exposure during this developmental window influences neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to acute stress. © 2019 Petrunich-Rutherford.

AB  - Background: Striatal-enriched Tyrosine Phosphatase (STEP) plays a key role in the mechanisms of neuronal signaling and is a potential molecular target for new generation of psychotropic drugs. STEP inhibitor, 8-(trifluoromethyl-1,2,3,4,5-benzopentathiepin-6-amine hydrochloride (TC-2153), shows anxiolytic effect on mice. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a suitable model for the study of anxiety pharmacology. Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of acute and chronic TC-2153 treatment on zebrafish anxiety-related behavior. Methods: The effects of acute (0.125 and 0.25 mg/l, 3 h) and chronic (0.125 mg/l, 14 days) administration of TC-2153 on locomotion and anxiety-related behavior (time spent near the bottom and mean distance from the bottom) of adult zebrafish in the Novel Tank (NT) test were compared with those of the same doses of fluoxetine chosen as a positive control. Results: Acute treatment with 0.125 mg/l and 0.25 mg/l of TC-2153 or fluoxetine decreased time spent near the bottom, increased time spent near the surface and increased mean distance from the bottom of tank. Chronic treatment with 0.125 mg/l of TC-2153 reduced only time spent near the tank bottom without any effect on time spent near the surface and mean distance from the bottom, while chronic administration of 0.125 mg/l of fluoxetine altered these three indices of anxiety. Conclusion: Both acute and chronic TC-2153 produces anxiety-like effect indicating STEP involved in the mechanism of anxiety-related behavior in zebrafish. At the same time, chronic treatment with TC-2153 reduced locomotor activity. Zebrafish is a promising laboratory object to study the role of STEP in the nervous system. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are widely used as a translational model for human neuropsychiatric conditions. Many studies have not considered sex differences in their analyses. Here, we studied sex differences of adult zebrafish in two behavioral domains: Anxiety and Memory. To assess whether sex influences anxiety-like responses, we used two different behavioral protocols, the novel tank diving task and the light–dark test. To assess sex differences in learning and memory tasks, we explored two memory domains, short-term spatial memory (free movement pattern Y-maze task) and short-term fear memory (Pavlovian fear-conditioning task). Although we did not find any significant difference in learning and memory tasks, female zebrafish showed robust increases in anxiety-like behavioral endpoints in both anxiety tests. Overall, our data suggest that zebrafish is a sensitive model to work with sex differences when modeling anxiety-related disorders and this should be an important factor to consider in different experimental designs. © 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Environmental enrichment involves increasing the complexity of a fish's environment in order to improve welfare. Researchers are legally obliged to consider the welfare of laboratory animals and poor welfare may result in less robust data in experimental science. Laboratory zebrafish Danio rerio are usually kept in bare aquaria for ease of husbandry and, despite being a well-studied species, little is known about how laboratory housing affects their welfare. This study shows that environmental enrichment, in the form of the addition of gravel substratum and plants into the tank, affects survivorship, growth and behaviour in laboratory-maintained D. rerio. Larvae reared in enriched tanks had significantly higher survivorship compared with larvae reared in bare tanks. Effects of the tank conditions on growth were more variable. Females from enriched tanks had a higher body condition than females maintained in bare tanks, but intriguingly this was not the case for males, where the only difference was a more variable body condition in males maintained in bare tanks. Sex ratio in the rearing tanks did not differ between treatments. Resource monopolisation was higher for fish in enriched tanks than for those in bare tanks. Fish from enriched tanks displayed lower levels of behaviours associated with anxiety compared with fish from bare tanks when placed into a novel environment. Thus, this study demonstrates differences in welfare for D. rerio maintained under different environmental conditions with enhancements in welfare more commonly associated with tank enrichment. © 2018 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles

AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are psychoactive pharmaceuticals that have been detected intact in natural waters globally. Laboratory experiments have reported that several SSRIs inhibit fish foraging behavior, but data for the SSRI escitalopram are lacking. The objectives of the present study were to determine whether escitalopram affects feeding behavior in zebrafish and whether possible sex differences exist. We exposed female and male zebrafish (Danio rerio) to 0.00, 0.10, and 1.50 µg/L of escitalopram in flow-through tanks for a 3-wk exposure period. We used a video tracking system with high temporal and spatial resolution to collect data on zebrafish swimming patterns in test tanks containing a food source. The results show a more pronounced effect of escitalopram in males compared with females. At the assumed most environmentally relevant concentration (0.10 µg/L), male average feeding time/visit and maximum feeding duration were significantly reduced by 27 and 42%, respectively. In addition, male total feeding duration was also significantly reduced (by 73%) at the highest concentration (1.50 µg/L). In females, only the maximum feeding duration was significantly reduced (by 41%) in the 0.10 µg/L treatment group. Hence, we reject our initial hypothesis that female feeding behavior is more vulnerable to escitalopram. There was no effect of escitalopram on length or weight among the experimental groups. The present study demonstrates that escitalopram, like other SSRIs, can inhibit fish foraging behavior and therefore potentially disturb natural food chains. Finally, our study suggests that SSRIs can both be sex and behavior specific. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1902–1910. © 2019 SETAC. © 2019 SETAC

AB  - Anxiety is a common symptom associated with high caffeine intake. Although the neurochemical mechanisms of caffeine-induced anxiety remain unclear, there are some evidences suggesting participation of oxidative stress. Based on these evidences, the current study is aimed at evaluating the possible protective effect of alpha-tocopherol (TPH) against anxiety-like behavior induced by caffeine (CAF) in zebrafish. Adult animals were treated with CAF (100 mg/kg) or TPH (1 mg/kg)+CAF before behavioral and biochemical evaluations. Oxidative stress in the zebrafish brain was evaluated by a lipid peroxidation assay, and anxiety-like behavior was monitored using light/dark preference and novel tank diving test. Caffeine treatment evoked significant elevation of brain MDA levels in the zebrafish brain, and TPH treatment prevented this increase. Caffeine treatment also induced anxiety-like behavior, while this effect was not observed in the TPH+CAF group. Taken together, the current study suggests that TPH treatment is able to inhibit oxidative stress and anxiety-like behavior evoked by caffeine. © 2019 Tayana Silva de Carvalho et al.

AB  - This study sought to examine the long-term behavioral impacts of dopamine D 1 and D 2 receptor antagonism during development in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Zebrafish embryos of both the AB* and 5D strains were exposed via immersion to either the D 1 receptor antagonist SCH-23,390 or the D 2 receptor antagonist haloperidol, at either 0.5 or 1.5-μM, from 5 h post-fertilization to 5 days post-fertilization. Aquarium water served as a control. Fish were then either tested as larvae on day 6 post-fertilization on a light/dark locomotor assay, or were grown to adulthood and tested on a behavioral battery that included assays for novel environment exploration, startle habituation, social affiliation, and predator escape (AB* strain only). Overall, developmental exposure to dopamine D 1 and D 2 receptor antagonists caused clear effects in larval locomotor behavior, driving hyperactivity in dark phases and hypoactivity in light phases. Additionally, control fish from the two strains were significantly different from each other (p &lt; 0.05) with the AB* fish being more active than SD during the dark periods of the test. In the adult behavioral battery, developmental exposure to 1.5-μM of the D 1 antagonist SCH-23390 significantly reduced activity (p &lt; 0.05) in the predator escape assay. Despite the fact that embryonic exposure to D 1 and D 2 receptor antagonists caused clear behavioral alterations in larval activity there were much more subtle effects persisting into adulthood. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biologists commonly visualize different features of an organism using distinct sources of illumination. Such multichannel imaging has largely not been applied to behavioral studies because of the challenges posed by a moving subject. We address this challenge with the technique of multichannel stroboscopic videography (MSV), which synchronizes multiple strobe lights with video exposures of a single camera. We illustrate the utility of this approach with kinematic measurements of a walking cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) and calculations of the pressure field around a swimming fish (Danio rerio). In both, transmitted illumination generated high-contrast images of the animal’s body in one channel. Other sources of illumination were used to visualize the points of contact for the feet of the cockroach and the water flow around the fish in separate channels. MSV provides an enhanced potential for high-throughput experimentation and the capacity to integrate changes in physiological or environmental conditions in freely-behaving animals. © 2019.

AB  - Larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) has the potential to supplement rodent models due to the availability of resource-efficient, high-throughput screening and high-resolution imaging techniques. Although behavioural models are available in larvae, only a few can be employed to assess anxiety. Here we present the swimming plus-maze (SPM) test paradigm, a tool to assess anxiety-related avoidance of shallow water bodies in early developmental stages. The “+” shaped apparatus consists of arms of different depth, representing different levels of aversiveness similarly to the rodent elevated plus-maze. The paradigm was validated (i) in larval and juvenile zebrafish, (ii) after administration of compounds affecting anxiety and (iii) in differentially aversive experimental conditions. Furthermore, we compared the SPM with conventional “anxiety tests” of zebrafish to identify their shared characteristics. We have clarified that the preference of deeper arms is ontogenetically conserved and can be abolished by anxiolytic or enhanced by anxiogenic agents, respectively. The behavioural readout is insensitive to environmental aversiveness and is unrelated to behaviours assessed by conventional tests involving young zebrafish. Taken together, we have developed a sensitive high-throughput test allowing the assessment of anxiety-related responses of zebrafish regardless of developmental stage, granting the opportunity to combine larva-based state-of-the-art methods with detailed behavioral analysis. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - In non-human mammals, exercise has been shown to decrease anxiety-like behavior. Conversely, a number of studies have reported no effect or even an increase in anxiety-like behavior after exercise, however, inconsistent training regimes and behavioral paradigms across studies may be confounding the results. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are a well-established animal model in neurobehavioral research, and have the potential to shed new insight into the effects of exercise on anxiety-like behavior where previous research has been limited, due to the ability to precisely control intensity and duration of exercise, and the validation of tests for measuring different aspects of anxiety-like behaviors. In the current study, fish were split between two treatment groups; Exercised and Control. Fish in the exercised condition were aerobically challenged (max water velocity: 0.5 m/s) using a swim tunnel one hour a day, five days a week, for six weeks. Control fish spent an equal amount of time in the swim tunnel but were not aerobically challenged (max water velocity: 0.05 m/s). After six weeks, all fish were tested individually in two standard complimentary anxiety tests for zebrafish: the novel tank test and the light-dark test. Exercised fish exhibited reduced anxiety-like behaviors in the novel tank test; they spent more time in the top and were quicker to enter the top of a novel tank compared to Control fish. In addition, Exercised fish spent more time in the light compartment of the light-dark test compared to Control fish. Our results demonstrate the beneficial effect of exercise on anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - As an excellent model organism, zebrafish have been widely applied in many fields. The accurate identification and tracking of individuals are crucial for zebrafish shoaling behaviour analysis. However, multi-zebrafish tracking still faces many challenges. It is difficult to keep identified for a long time due to fish overlapping caused by the crossings. Here we proposed an improved Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) algorithm to calculate the stable back texture feature map of zebrafish, then tracked multi-zebrafish in a fully automated fashion with low sample size, high tracking accuracy and wide applicability. The performance of the tracking algorithm was evaluated in 11 videos with different numbers and different sizes of zebrafish. In the Right-tailed hypothesis test of Wilcoxon, our method performed better than idTracker, with significant higher tracking accuracy. Throughout the video of 16 zebrafish, the training sample of each fish had only 200-500 image samples, one-fifth of the idTracker's sample size. Furthermore, we applied the tracking algorithm to analyse the depression and hypoactivity behaviour of zebrafish shoaling. We achieved correct identification of depressed zebrafish among the fish shoal based on the accurate tracking results that could not be identified by a human. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The measurement of multiple behavior endpoints in zebrafish can provide informative clues within neurobehavioral field. However, multiple behavior evaluations usually require complicated and costly instrumental settings. Here, we reported a versatile setting that applied ten acrylic tanks arranging into five vertical layers and two horizontal columns to perform multiple behavior assays simultaneously, such as the novel tank diving test, mirror-biting test, social interaction, shoaling, and predator escape assay. In total, ten behavioral performance were collected in a single video, and the XY coordination of fish locomotion can be tracked by using open source software of idTracker and ImageJ. We validated our setting by examining zebrafish behavioral changes after exposure to low dose ethanol (EtOH) for 96 h. Fish were observed staying longer time at bottom of the tank, less mirror biting interest, higher freezing time, less fear in predator test, and tight shoaling behaviors which indicated the anxiogenic effect was induced by low dosage exposure of EtOH in zebrafish. In conclusion, the setting in this study provided a simple, versatile and cost-effective way to assess multiple behavioral endpoints in zebrafish with high reliability and reproducibility for the first time. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Behavioral responses inform toxicology studies by rapidly and sensitively detecting molecular initiation events that propagate to physiological changes in individuals. These behavioral responses can be unique to chemical specific mechanisms and modes of action (MOA) and thus present diagnostic utility. In an initial effort to explore the use of larval fish behavioral response patterns in screening environmental contaminants for toxicity and to identify behavioral responses associated with common chemical specific MOAs, we employed the two most common fish models, the zebrafish and the fathead minnow, to define toxicant induced swimming activity alterations during interchanging photoperiods. Though the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) is a common model for aquatic toxicology research and regulatory toxicology practice, this model has received little attention in behavioral studies compared to the zebrafish, a common biomedical model. We specifically compared behavioral responses among 7 different chemicals (1-heptanol, phenol, R-(-)-carvone, citalopram, diazinon, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), and xylazine) that were selected and classified based on anticipated MOA (nonpolar narcosis, polar narcosis, electrophile, specific mechanism) according to traditional approaches to examine whether these comparative responses differ among chemicals with various structure-based predicted toxicity. Following standardized experimental guidelines, zebrafish embryos and fathead minnow larvae were exposed for 96 h to each compound then were observed using digital behavioral analysis. Behavioral observations included photomotor responses, distance traveled, and stimulatory, refractory and cruising locomotor activity. Though fathead minnow larvae displayed greater behavioral sensitivity to 1-heptanol, phenol and citalopram, zebrafish were more sensitive to diazinon and R-(-)-carvone. Both fish models were equally sensitive to xylazine and PTZ. Further, the pharmaceuticals citalopram and xylazine significantly affected behavior at therapeutic hazard values, and each of the seven chemicals elicited unique behavioral response profiles. Larval fish behaviors appear useful as early tier diagnostics to identify mechanisms and pathways associated with diverse biological activities for chemicals lacking mechanistic data. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is a syndrome characterized by neurological and behavioral impairments. A recently discovered hallmark of FASD is impaired social behavior. Avoidance of social interaction typical of FASD may be the result of increased anxiety. Previously, the zebrafish was successfully used to model embryonic alcohol induced social abnormalities. Here, we analyzed both anxiety and social responses using a zebrafish FASD model, in adult fish. We exposed zebrafish embryos to low concentrations of ethanol (0.1%; 0.25%; 0.5% and 1% v/v) for 2 h at, 24 h post-fertilization, to mimic the most prevalent milder FASD cases, and investigated the ensuing alterations in adult, 4-month-old, zebrafish. We studied social interaction in the social preference task and anxiety in the novel tank task. We observed an ethanol dose dependent reduction of time spend in the conspecific zone compared to control, corroborating prior findings. We also found significant changes in the novel tank (e.g. increased bottom dwell time, increased distance to top) suggesting elevated anxiety to control, but we also found, using an anxiolytic drug buspirone, that reduction of anxiety is associated with reduced shoaling. Our results confirm that embryonic alcohol exposure disrupts social behavior, and also show that its effects on anxiety related phenotypes may be genotype, alcohol administration method, experimental procedure and test-context dependent. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ethnobotanical relevance: Spondias mombin L. is a plant dispersed throughout the tropical regions of South America, Africa, and Asia, being found mainly in the North and Northeast of Brazil, where the leaves are used in preparations for neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to carry out studies in different pharmacological models that can prove the traditional use of this plant species. Materials and methods: the hydroethanolic extract from S. mombin leaves (HELSm) was evaluated by oral administration (25 mg/kg) and by immersion (25 mg/l) in scototaxis test in zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this study, caffeine (100 mg/kg) and buspirone (25 mg/kg) were used as standard drugs. The antidepressant action of the HELSm was evaluated assessed in the novel tank diving test (NTDT). In this study, a group with 1% ethanol, one with unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS), and another with developmental, social isolation (DSI) were used as induction groups for depression-like behavior and fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) as a drug pattern. Results: by the HPLC-UV fingerprint analysis, the HELSm presented several derivatives of polyphenolic compounds and flavonoids and identified ellagic acid and isoquercitrin, and by the gas-chromatographic, the majority of the identified compounds were fatty acids, esters, and alcohols. By immersion, the LC50 was 49.86 mg/l and by oral via the LD50 in 48 h, was 4.515 g/kg in zebrafish. For all spatiotemporal and behavioral variables (time spent, white compartment, latency, toggle, erratic swimming, freezing duration, thigmotaxis, and risk assessment), the treatment with HELSm produced a similar effect to buspirone and was significant when compared to the caffeine and control group (p &lt; 0.01, Tukey-Kramer test). For all spatiotemporal and behavioral variables evaluated (time spent at the top of the apparatus, crossed quadrants, erratic swimming, and duration of freezing), treatment with HELSm produced a change in the depression-like behavior in the groups tested, with a similar effect to fluoxetine, both with a significant difference when compared to the control groups (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the acute administration of the HELSm in the scototaxis and NTDT tests in a zebrafish model (Danio rerio) produced anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, devoid of hypnotic and sedative actions by immersion, and this action was improved when administered by oral via. Possibly, the presence of isoquercitrin in the leaves of Spondias mombin participates in the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many animals exhibit behavioral plasticity as they move between habitats seasonally, reside in fluctuating environments, or respond to human-induced environmental change. We know that physical environment during early development can have a lasting impact on behavior, and on the neural mechanisms that shape behavior. In adults, social context can have similar persistent effects on behavior and the brain. Here, we asked whether physical context impacts adult social behavior in a novel environment. We placed groups of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in two different physical contexts. After two weeks, we measured group behavior in a novel context, and found that zebrafish with recent experience in a more-complex physical environment charged each other more often and tended to form tighter shoals than did fish that had been housed in less-complex environments. These differences were present regardless of the novel context in which we assayed behavior, and were not easily explained by differences in activity level. Our results demonstrate the impact of recent experiences on adult behavior, and highlight the importance of physical as well as social history in predicting animal behavior in novel situations. © 2018 Sykes et al.

AB  - Ayahuasca is a psychoactive concoction prepared from the plants Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis which are used ancestrally by Amazonian Indian populations and more recently, by Christian religious groups in Brazil and other countries. The aims of the present study were to identify the effects of ayahuasca on zebrafish embryo development and neurobehavior. Toxicity and developmental endpoints for zebrafish embryos were assessed from 0 to 1000 mg/L over 96 h of exposure. The effects on locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae were assessed using a video tracking system (ZebraBox) from 0 to 20 mg/L and after 120 and 144 h of exposure. The LC50 of ayahuasca in zebrafish was determined as 236.3 mg/L. Ayahuasca exposure caused significant developmental anomalies in zebrafish embryos, mainly at the highest concentration tested, including hatching delay, loss of equilibrium, edema and the accumulation of red blood cells. Embryo behavior was also significantly affected, with decreased locomotor activity at the highest concentration tested. These results are in accordance with data obtained in mammal studies highlighting the possible risks of uncontrolled use of ayahuasca. Further research employing more specific behavior analysis could provide additional data on both therapeutic benefits and possible toxicological risk of ayahuasca. © 2018

AB  - Antidepressants are used by a substantial number of women in their childbearing years. Treatment may continue during pregnancy, since untreated depression poses a risk to the mother and child. However, many antidepressants readily pass through the placental barrier to reach the fetus or may be ingested by the newborn via breastmilk. Little is known about the effects of antidepressants on brain development and subsequent behavior in young children. In the current study, we used zebrafish as a model system to examine the neurodevelopmental effects of three commonly prescribed antidepressants, sertraline, duloxetine and bupropion. Zebrafish were exposed to these antidepressants during development and were examined for changes in larval avoidance behavior, activity, social behaviors, and anxiety-related behaviors. The results show that antidepressants commonly affect larval swim speeds and resting, and differentially affect other behaviors depending upon the exposure period. Using cluster analysis profiling, we compared the obtained results to previous reports on behavioral defects induced by organophosphate pesticides. We found that the behavioral profiles induced by antidepressants and pesticides overlap, indicating a common mechanism of action. We conclude that developmental antidepressant exposures lead to specific behavioral changes in zebrafish larvae. At present, it is not known if antidepressants have similar effects in human development. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Ethanol (EtOH) is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant drug that modifies various behavioral domains (i.e., sociability, aggressiveness, and memory) by promoting disinhibition of punished operant behavior and neurochemical changes. Taurine (TAU) is a β-amino sulfonic acid with pleiotropic roles in the brain. Although exogenous TAU is found in energy drinks and often mixed with alcohol in beverages, the putative risks of mixing TAU and EtOH are poorly explored. Here, we investigated whether TAU modulates social and fear responses by assessing shoaling behavior, preference for conspecifics, and antipredatory behavior of adult zebrafish acutely exposed to EtOH. Zebrafish shoals (4 fish per shoal) were exposed to water (control), TAU (42, 150, and 400 mg/L), 0.25% (v/v) EtOH alone or in association with TAU for 1 h, and their behaviors were analyzed at different time intervals (0–5 min, 30–35 min, and 55–60 min). The effects of TAU and EtOH were further tested in a social preference test and during exposure to a predator. Both EtOH and TAU co-treated fish showed a higher shoal dispersion, while TAU 400/EtOH group shoal area had a similar profile when compared to control. However, in the social preference test, TAU 400/EtOH impaired the seeking for conspecifics. Regarding fear-like behaviors, TAU-cotreated fish showed a prominent reduction in risk assessments when compared to EtOH alone. Overall, we demonstrate that TAU modulates EtOH-induced changes in different behavioral domains, suggesting a complex relationship between social and fear-like responses. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effects of different concentrations of commercial product based on tebuconazole, on adults of Danio rerio, were evaluated through novel tank diving test and micronucleus and comet assay tests. A total of 320 adult D. rerio were divided into eight tanks and exposed to concentrations of 0; 100; 200 and 300 μg/L the commercial product based on tebuconazole, with their respective replicates at 24, 72 and 96 h. The results showed a behavioral deviation of zebrafish and a significant (p < 0.05) increase in DNA damage as a function of exposed time and different concentrations of the commercial product in relation to the negative control. The results obtained in this study allow to conclude that tebuconazole has effects on adults of Danio rerio, inducing genotoxicity and mutagenicity, as well as altering neurological functions related to the change in the behavior of adults. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Zebrafish, a highly-social species of freshwater fish, are widely studied across many fields of laboratory science including developmental biology, neuroscience, and genomics. Nevertheless, as standard housing for zebrafish typically consists of small and simplistic environments, less is known about their social behavioral repertoire in more naturalistic settings. In particular, spontaneously occurring, socio-positive affiliative behaviors (e.g., social coordination and cohesion) that may be indicative of positive emotional experiences have rarely been reported or studied deliberately in zebrafish. Housing adult zebrafish (10 fish/tank) in large semi-natural tanks (110 L; n = 6) with sloping gravel substrate, rocks, and artificial plants, we observed a previously undescribed behavior: Distinct periods of spontaneous, synchronized, compact aggregations, what we call “heightened-shoaling”. This project aimed to quantify the characteristics of this distinctive behavior and compare parameters of heightened-shoaling to baseline periods (normal behavior) and pre-feed periods (feed-anticipatory behavior). First, across 4 days, we selected video-clips (100 s each) from within (i) instances of heightened-shoaling (n = 9), (ii) baseline periods (n = 18), and (iii) pre-feed periods (n = 18). For each of these video clips, we scan sampled every 10 s to determine fish orientations and location within the tank and agonistic behavior. Next, we used an all-occurrence sampling method to record the timing and duration of all episodes of heightened-shoaling behavior when tank-lights were on (8:00 h to 18:00 h) across 10 days. From the scan-sampling data, we found that compared to baseline periods, heightened-shoaling was characterized by increased shoal cohesion (p < 0.0001), increased adherence to the horizontal plane (p < 0.0001), decreased agonism (p < 0.0001), and no diving behavior (lower positions within the water column signal negative effect in zebrafish, p > 0.1). From the all-occurrence sampling data, we found 31 episodes of heightened-shoaling with instances observed in all six tanks and only a single case in which heightened-shoaling occurred in two tanks at the same time. The median episode duration was 7.6 min (Range 1.3–28.6). As the first systematic description of heightened-shoaling behavior, this research contributes to our knowledge of the range of zebrafish social dynamics living in naturalistic environments. Moreover, as a spontaneously occurring, protracted, affiliative behavior, heightened-shoaling appears to be a good candidate for future research into positive emotional behavior in zebrafish. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotomimetic compound of the Cannabis sativa that has been used for the treatment of severe epilepsy as well as other diseases of nervous system. However, toxicity studies of CBD have great relevance to guarantee the patients safety. In this context, morphological analyses of zebrafish can contribute to evaluate the teratogenic potential, as well as evaluation of acetylcholinesterase activity and motor activity of zebrafish are valuable tools to verify the neurotoxicity potential. In the present work, we use this methodology to test the toxicity of CBD to zebrafish embryos. No malformation was observed in morphological analysis of embryos exposed to all tested concentrations of CBD. Although, twenty per cent of embryos exposed to maximal dose of CBD (300 μg/L) hatched after 96hpf, while embryos in control solution had already hatched in this period. Embryos exposed to CBD did not show differences in acetylcholinesterase activity, but embryos exposed to CBD 20–300 μg/L were 1.4 up to 1.7-fold more active when compared to the control. Despite that, at 48 hpf, motor activity returned to control values. Our results suggest that the effects observed after CBD exposure are intimately related to CB1 receptor that is present in zebrafish since early stages of development. The present work showed early light effects induced by CBD exposure in concentrations that did not alter biochemical activity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Cannabis sativa plant contains numerous phytocannabinoids and terpenes with known or potential biological activity. For decades, plant breeders have been breeding the Cannabis plant to control for a desired ratio of the major cannabinoids. A high-throughput in vivo model to understand the relationship between the chemical composition of different strains and their therapeutic potential then becomes of value. Measuring changes in the behavioral patterns of zebrafish larvae is an established model with which to test the biological activity of neuroactive compounds. However, there is currently little information regarding the uptake kinetics and metabolism of compounds by larvae. In this study, we chose to compare the uptake kinetics and metabolism of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) alone or in combination with their effects on larval behavior. We have shown that both compounds have distinct behavioral patterns and concentration response profiles. Additionally, the uptake kinetics observed for each compound appears to correlate with the change in behavior observed in the behavioral assays. When combinations of THC and CBD were tested there were shifts in both the behavioral activity and the uptake kinetics of each compound compared with when they were tested alone. Finally, the THC/CBD-derived metabolites detected in the larvae are similar to those found in mammalian systems. This study thus provides a model for further testing of additional cannabinoids and potentially plant extracts. © 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - The rewarding properties of drugs in zebrafish can be studied using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. Most devices that have been used for CPP consist of two-half tanks with or without a central chamber. Here we evaluated the rewarding effects of nicotine and caffeine using a tank with five arms distributed radially from a central chamber that we have denoted Fish Tank Radial Maze (FTRM). Zebrafish were trained to associate nicotine or caffeine with a coloured arm. In testing sessions to assess CPP induction, between two and five different arms were available to explore. We found that when offering the two arms, one of them associated to the drug mediating conditioning for 14 days, zebrafish showed nicotine-induced CPP but not caffeine-induced CPP. When zebrafish had the option to explore drug-paired arms together with new coloured arms as putative distractors, the nicotine-CPP strength was maintained for at least three days. The presence of novel environments induced caffeine-CPP, which was still positive after three days of testing sessions. Complementary behavioural data supported these findings. Nicotine-CPP was prevented by the histone deacetylase inhibitor phenylbutyrate administered during conditioning; however, there were no effects on caffeine-CPP. The specific acetylation of lysine 9 in histone 3 (H3-K9) was increased in nicotine-conditioned zebrafish brains. This study suggests that novel environmental cues facilitate drug-environment associations, and hence, the use of drugs of abuse. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Personality traits are related to many aspects of one’s life, including risk taking, sociability, and behavioral changes caused by psychoactive substances. This study aimed to investigate individual differences and behavioral changes due to alcohol exposure in zebrafish (Danio rerio). To that end, adult animals were separated into two behavioral profiles: bold and shy, according to their risk taking behavior in an emergence test. Bold and shy fish were allowed to explore a 5-chamber tank and were tested for exploration and sociability (shoaling behavior) following alcohol exposure. The acute drug exposure treatments were 0.0%, 0.1% and 0.5% (v/v%) alcohol. The behavioral parameters evaluated were average and maximum swimming speed, total distance traveled, total time spent immobile, and time spent near a shoal or exploring the tank. For the groups that received no alcohol (0.0% alcohol), shy individuals spent more time near the shoal than bold fish. However, 0.5% alcohol increased bold fish responsiveness to the shoal, while both 0.1% and 0.5% alcohol diminished shoaling in shy fish. Our results show that the behavioral profiles of zebrafish are affected differently by alcohol, with shy animals seemingly more sensitive to behavioral change due to drug exposure. Moreover, we confirm zebrafish as a model for alcohol induced functional (exploration and social behavior) changes that could be useful in high throughput drug screens. © 2018 Araujo-Silva et al.

AB  - Amitriptyline is a commonly used tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) inhibiting serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. The exact CNS action of TCAs remains poorly understood, necessitating new screening approaches and novel model organisms. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly emerging as a promising tool for pharmacological research of antidepressants, including amitriptyline. Here, we examine the effects of chronic 2-week exposure to 10 and 50 μg/L amitriptyline on zebrafish behavior and monoamine neurotransmitters. Overall, the drug at 50 μg/L evoked pronounced anxiolytic-like effects in the novel tank test (assessed by more time in top, fewer transition and shorter latency to enter the top). Like other TCAs, amitriptyline reduced serotonin turnover, but also significantly elevated whole-brain norepinephrine and dopamine levels. The latter effect was not reported in this model previously, and accompanied higher brain expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (a rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis), but unaltered expression of dopamine-β-hydroxylase and monoamine oxidase (the enzymes of dopamine metabolism). This response may underlie chronic amitriptyline action on dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmission, and contribute to the complex CNS profile of this drug observed both clinically and in animal models. Collectively, these findings also confirm the important role of monoamine modulation in the regulation of anxiety-related behavior in zebrafish, and support the utility of this organism as a promising in-vivo model for CNS drug screening. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Background: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were widely used as flame retardants until the early 2000s, mainly in home furnishings and electronics. The persistence of PBDEs in the environment leads to continued ubiquitous exposure to low levels, with infants and children experiencing higher exposures than adults. Accumulating evidence suggest that low-level exposures during early life stages can affect brain development and lead to long-term behavioral impairments. We investigated the effects of zebrafish exposure to low doses of the two prominent PBDEs; 2,2′,4,4′,5,-Pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-99) and 2,2′,4,4′,-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), during embryo-development on short- and long-term behavioral endpoints. We included the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) due to its well documented neurotoxicity across species from zebrafish to humans. Methods: Zebrafish embryos were exposed to the following individual treatments; 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control); 0.3 μM CPF; 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 μM BDE-47; 0.003, 0.03, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 20 μM BDE-99 from 5 until 120 h post fertilization (hpf). Low exposure levels were determined as those not causing immediate overt toxicity, and behavior assays were conducted in the low-level range. At 144 hpf the larvae were tested for locomotor activity. At approximately 6 months of age adult zebrafish were tested in a behavioral battery including assays for anxiety-related behavior, sensorimotor response and habituation, social interaction, and predator avoidance. Results: In the short-term, larval locomotor activity was reduced in larvae treated with 0.3 μM CPF and 0.1 μM BDE-47. BDE-99 treatment caused non-monotonic dose effects, with 0.3 μM causing hyperactivity and 1 μM or higher causing hypoactivity. In the long-term, adult anxiety-related behavior was reduced in all treatments as measured in both the novel tank dive test and tap test. Discussion: We show that exposure of zebrafish embryos to low concentrations of the brominated flame retardants BDE-47 and BDE-99, and the organophosphate pesticide CPF, caused both short- and long-term behavioral impairments. Interestingly, we also found that at very low exposure concentrations, where there were no visible effects on larval activity, adult behavior was still strongly affected. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, a semi-automatic multi-object tracking method to track a group of unmarked zebrafish is proposed. This method can handle partial occlusion cases, maintaining the correct identity of each individual. For every object, we extracted a set of geometric features to be used in the two main stages of the algorithm. The first stage selected the best candidate, based both on the blobs identified in the image and the estimate generated by a Kalman Filter instance. In the second stage, if the same candidate-blob is selected by two or more instances, a blob-partitioning algorithm takes place in order to split this blob and reestablish the instances’ identities. If the algorithm cannot determine the identity of a blob, a manual intervention is required. This procedure was compared against a manual labeled ground truth on four video sequences with different numbers of fish and spatial resolution. The performance of the proposed method is then compared against two well-known zebrafish tracking methods found in the literature: one that treats occlusion scenarios and one that only track fish that are not in occlusion. Based on the data set used, the proposed method outperforms the first method in correctly separating fish in occlusion, increasing its efficiency by at least 8.15% of the cases. As for the second, the proposed method's overall performance outperformed the second in some of the tested videos, especially those with lower image quality, because the second method requires high-spatial resolution images, which is not a requirement for the proposed method. Yet, the proposed method was able to separate fish involved in occlusion and correctly assign its identity in up to 87.85% of the cases, without accounting for user intervention. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Anxiety, trauma- and stressor-related disorders are severe psychiatric conditions that affect human population worldwide. Given their genetic tractability, evolutionarily conserved neurotransmitter systems, and extensive behavioral repertoire, zebrafish have become an emergent model organism in translational neuroscience. Here, we investigate whether a single exposure to conspecific alarm substance (CAS) produces fear conditioning in zebrafish using a conditioned place aversion (CPA) paradigm, as well as the persistence of aversive responses at different time intervals. While CAS elicited freezing and erratic movements at conditioning phase, zebrafish showed a robust avoidance for the CAS-paired compartment and increased risk assessment up to 7 days postconditioning. Additionally, we observed the existence of two behavioral phenotypes (high- and low-avoider fish) that present different fear-like responses at conditioning phase and evasion of the conditioning side at postconditioning trials. Collectively, we show a prolonged conditioned place aversion in zebrafish after a single CAS conditioning session, reinforcing the use of fear conditioning protocols as valuable strategies for modeling psychiatric disorders-related phenotypes in zebrafish. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Impaired attention is the hallmark consequence of prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE), affecting brain development, learning, memory and social adaptation starting at an early age. To date, little is known about the brain structures and neurochemical processes involved in this effect. Through focusing on the visual system and employing zebrafish as a model, we show that PCE reduces expression of dopamine receptor Drd1, with levels reduced in the optic tectum and other brain regions, but not the telencephalon. Organism-wide, PCE results in a 1.7-fold reduction in the expression of the dopamine transporter (dat), at baseline. Acute cocaine administration leads to a 2-fold reduction in dat in drug-naive larvae but not PCE fish. PCE sensitizes animals to an anxiogenic-like behavioral effect of acute cocaine, bottom-dwelling, while loss of DAT due to genetic knockout (DATKO) leads to bottom-dwelling behavior at baseline. Neuronal calcium responses to visual stimuli in both PCE and DATKO fish show tolerance to acute cocaine in the principal regions of visual attention, the telencephalon and optic tectum. The zebrafish model can provide a sensitive assay by which to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and brain region-specific consequences of PCE, and facilitate the search for effective therapeutic solutions. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society

AB  - It has been reported that the use of certain stimuli can lead to anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish. Moreover, visual stimulation of zebrafish is becoming a popular tool. Here we evaluated the effects of six colors combinations and alprazolam, a benzodiazepine which is widely used in the treatment of anxiety disorders, on the behavior of adult zebrafish in a two-chambered apparatus, which chambers were illuminated by red/yellow, green/blue, red/green, green/yellow, red/blue and blue/yellow light. The following parameters were measured: time spent in the zone, number of entries to the zone, time of freezing, distance traveled and average speed in the zone. We report that the adult zebrafish spent more time in the red zone compared to yellow or green as well as in the yellow or blue compared to green. The zebrafish displayed a concomitant increase in time freezing in the red zone compared to yellow or green as well as in the yellow or blue compared to green. Moreover, average speed was decreased in the red zone compared to yellow or green and in the yellow zone compared to green. Treatment with alprazolam significantly affected the behavior of the zebrafish, e.g., following alprazolam administration time spent in the zone and time freezing were longer in the green zone than in red. Based on these observations, we suggest that light color combinations could be effective to manipulate zebrafish behavior and could be useful in neuropsychopharmacological studies, perhaps to study anxiety-like behavior and the effects of anxiolytic agents. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) is increasing despite insufficient information concerning their long-term effects, including the effects of maternal e-cigarette use on pre- and postnatal development. Our previous study demonstrated that developmental exposure to 1,2-propanediol (a principal component of e-cigarette liquid) affected early development of zebrafish, causing reduced growth, deformities, and hyperactive swimming behavior in larvae. The current study extends assessment of the developmental toxicity of 1,2-propanediol by examining additional long-term behavioral effects. We demonstrate that embryonic/larval exposure of zebrafish to 1,2-propanediol (0.625% or 1.25%) not only affected behavioral parameters in the larvae, but also caused persisting behavioral effects in adults after early developmental exposure. Additional parameters, including neural and vascular development in larvae, stress response in adults, and concentration of neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin in adult brain were examined, in order to explain the behavioral differences. These additional assessments did not find 1,2-propanediol exposure to significantly affect Tg(Neurog1:GFP) or the transcript abundance of neural genes (Neurog1, Ascl1a, Elavl3, and Lef1). Vascular development was not found to be affected by 1,2-propanediol exposure, as inferred from experiments with Tg(Flk1:eGFP) zebrafish; however, transcript abundance of vascular genes (Flk1, Vegf, Tie-2, and Angpt1) was decreased. No statistically significant changes were noted for plasma cortisol or brain neurotransmitters in adult fish. Lastly, analysis of gene transcripts involved with 1,2-propanediol metabolism (Adh5, Aldh2.1, and Ldha) showed an increase in Adh5 transcript. This is the first study to demonstrate that developmental exposure to 1,2-propanediol has long-term neurobehavioral consequences in adult zebrafish, showing that e-cigarettes contain substances potentially harmful to neurodevelopment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Generally, the measurement of three-dimensional (3D) swimming behavior in zebrafish relies on commercial software or requires sophisticated scripts, and depends on more than two cameras to capture the video. Here, we establish a simple and economic apparatus to detect 3D locomotion in zebrafish, which involves a single camera capture system that records zebrafish movement in a specially designed water tank with a mirror tilted at 45 degrees. The recorded videos are analyzed using idTracker, while spatial positions are calibrated by ImageJ software and 3D trajectories are plotted by Origin 9.1 software. This easy setting allowed scientists to track 3D swimming behavior of multiple zebrafish with low cost and precise spatial position, showing great potential for fish behavioral research in the future. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Background Although aggression is a common symptom of psychiatric disorders the drugs available to treat it are non-specific and can have unwanted side effects. The zebrafish is an ideal model for aggression research. Zebrafish are small, amenable to genetic and pharmacological manipulation, and agonistic behaviour can be measured reliably. New method In this study we have established a novel setup to automatically quantify aggression and locomotion in one-month old juvenile zebrafish, a stage at which fish exhibit adult-like behaviour but are small so that one camera can film several animals. Results We have validated our novel software by comparison to manual quantification of behaviour, characterised the aggression of one-month old fish, and demonstrated that we can detect alterations to aggression caused by mutation or drug application. Comparison with other methods The ability to record up to 12 juvenile fish allows us to speed up and standardise data acquisition compared to studies of single fish. Conclusions This setup appears to be suitable to screen for drugs that decrease zebrafish aggression as a first step toward developing novel treatments for this behaviour. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread environmental contaminants that occur in complex mixtures. Several PAHs are known or suspected mutagens and/or carcinogens, but developmental toxicity data is lacking for PAHs, particularly their oxygenated and nitrated derivatives. Such data are necessary to understand and predict the toxicity of environmental mixtures. 123 PAHs were assessed for morphological and neurobehavioral effects for a range of concentrations between 0.1 and 50 µM, using a high throughput early-life stage zebrafish assay, including 33 parent, 22 nitrated, 17 oxygenated, 19 hydroxylated, 14 methylated, 16 heterocyclic, and 2 aminated PAHs. Additionally, each PAH was evaluated for AHR activation, by assessing CYP1A protein expression using whole animal immunohistochemistry (IHC). Responses to PAHs varied in a structurally dependent manner. High-molecular weight PAHs were significantly more developmentally toxic than the low-molecular weight PAHs, and CYP1A expression was detected in five distinct tissues, including vasculature, liver, skin, neuromasts and yolk. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Alcohol hangover refers to unpleasant symptoms experienced as a direct consequence of a binge drinking episode. The effects observed in this condition are related to the increase in alcohol metabolites and imbalance in oxidative status. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a mucolytic agent and an antidote for paracetamol overdose. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that NAC is a multi-target drug acting through neuroprotective, antioxidant and neurotrophic mechanisms as well as a glutamate modulator. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of NAC in zebrafish acutely exposed to ethanol (EtOH). Animals pretreated or not with NAC (1 mg/L, 10 min) were exposed for 60 min to standard tank water (EtOH−) or to 1% EtOH (EtOH+) to evaluate anxiety-like behavior and locomotion in the novel tank test and oxidative damage in the brain. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to EtOH displayed a decrease in the distance traveled, crossings, entries and time spent in the top area in the novel tank test. Exposure to EtOH also caused oxidative damage, shown by increased lipid peroxidation, decreased non-protein thiols and increased production of reactive oxygen species (DCF assay). NAC prevented both the behavioral alterations and the oxidative stress observed in EtOH+ animals. Given the effects of NAC in preventing the acute behavioral and biochemical effects of EtOH, additional studies are warranted to further investigate the basis of its anecdotal use to prevent hangover. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Several studies have shown that manipulations to the housing environment modulate susceptibility to stress in laboratory animals, mainly in rodents. Environmental enrichment (EE) is one such manipulation that promotes neuroprotection and neurogenesis, besides affecting behaviors such as drug self-administration. Zebrafish are a popular and useful animal model for behavioral neuroscience studies; however, studies evaluating the impact of housing conditions in this species are scarce. In this study, we verified the effects of EE on behavioral (novel tank test) and biochemical [cortisol and reactive oxygen species (ROS)] parameters in zebrafish submitted to unpredictable chronic stress (UCS). Consistent with our previous findings, UCS increased anxiety-like behavior, cortisol and ROS levels in zebrafish. EE for 21 or 28 days attenuated the effects induced by UCS on behavior and cortisol, and prevented the effects on ROS levels. Our findings reinforce the idea that EE exerts neuromodulatory effects across species, reducing vulnerability to stress and its biochemical impact. Also, these results indicate that zebrafish is a suitable model animal to study the behavioral effects and neurobiological mechanisms related to EE. © 2018. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd

AB  - Studies with zebrafish use acclimatizing periods of at least one week immediately before the experiments. During this time, animals can be housed in sexually segregated conditions (only females or males in the tank) or in mixed-sex conditions (both sexes in the tank). The influence of sex and housing conditions regarding the presence of one or two sexes is largely unknown in zebrafish. Our aim was to evaluate the influence that sex and housing regarding the sex of animals had in the open tank task, in the inhibitory avoidance memory test, in cortisol levels and weight in zebrafish. Four groups of animals were used: 1) segregated housed females (only females were kept in the tank); 2) segregated housed males (only males were kept in the tank); 3) mixed-sex housed females (only females were analyzed from a tank containing 50% ratio of each sex); 4) mixed-sex housed males (only males were analyzed from a tank containing 50% ratio of each sex). Males showed higher total distance travelled and mean speed when compared to females. In the inhibitory avoidance memory, sexually segregated animals had higher latencies than their mixed-sex counterparts in the 1 day test and sexually segregated females presented a memory that persisted longer and was able to be reinstated. Whole-body cortisol levels were higher in mixed-sex animals while weight was lower in these fish. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that effects of sex and housing regarding sex were investigated in behavior and physiology of zebrafish. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anchovies are filter-feeding fish that inhabit nearshore environments worldwide. With increasing human pharmaceutical use, drugs that alter neurological functioning are becoming more prevalent in aquatic ecosystems via wastewater effluent, creating the need for tests that can reliably determine sublethal effects of these drugs on coastal fish populations. In this study, we used Caribbean anchovies (Anchoa spp.) as a tropical marine fish model to test drug-induced alterations of locomotion and shoaling behaviour with a video-based analysis system. Consistent with its anxiolytic effects in zebrafish (Danio rerio), ethanol decreased shoal cohesion in anchovies. We also characterized the effects of drugs known to modulate the dopaminergic system in zebrafish and rodents. A D1 receptor agonist (SKF 38393) and a D1 receptor antagonist (SCH 23390) increased the time anchovy spent in the center of the arena, but neither drug had an impact on shoal cohesion. Finally, the D1 receptor agonist caused significantly lower meandering compared with fish treated with the D1 receptor antagonist and ethanol. This study suggests that anchovy is a suitable Caribbean marine model for toxicology studies. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - The zebrafish is a social vertebrate and an excellent translational model for a variety of human disorders. Abnormal social behavior is a hallmark of several human brain disorders. Social behavioral problems can arise as a result of adverse early social environment. Little is known about the effects of early social isolation in adult zebrafish. We compared zebrafish that were isolated for either short (7 days) or long duration (180 days) to socially housed zebrafish, testing their behavior across ontogenesis (ages 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 days), and shoal cohesion and whole-brain monoamines and their metabolites in adulthood. Long social isolation increased locomotion and decreased shoal cohesion and anxiety in the open-field in adult. Additionally, both short and long social isolation reduced dopamine metabolite levels in response to social stimuli. Thus, early social isolation has lasting effects in zebrafish, and may be employed to generate zebrafish models of human neuropsychiatric conditions. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The misfolding of cellular prion protein (PrPC) to form PrP Scrapie (PrPSc) is an exemplar of toxic gain-of-function mechanisms inducing propagated protein misfolding and progressive devastating neurodegeneration. Despite this, PrPC function in the brain is also reduced and subverted during prion disease progression; thus understanding the normal function of PrPC in healthy brains is key. Disrupting PrPC in mice has led to a myriad of controversial functions that sometimes map onto disease symptoms, including a proposed role in memory or learning. Intriguingly, PrPC interaction with amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers at synapses has also linked its function to Alzheimer's disease and dementia in recent years. We set out to test the involvement of PrPC in memory using a disparate animal model, the zebrafish. Here we document an age-dependent memory decline in prp2-/- zebrafish, pointing to a conserved and ancient role of PrPC in memory. Specifically, we found that aged (3-year-old) prp2-/-fish performed poorly in an object recognition task relative to agematched prp2+/+ fish or 1-year-old prp2-/- fish. Further, using a novel object approach (NOA) test, we found that aged (3-year-old) prp2-/- fish approached the novel object more than either age-matched prp2+/+ fish or 1-year-old prp2-/- fish, but did not have decreased anxiety when we tested them in a novel tank diving test. Taken together, the results of the NOA and novel tank diving tests suggest an altered cognitive appraisal of the novel object in the 3-year-old prp2-/- fish. The learning paradigm established here enables a path forward to study PrPC interactions of relevance to Alzheimer's disease and prion diseases, and to screen for candidate therapeutics for these diseases. The findings underpin a need to consider the relative contributions of loss- versus gain-of-function of PrPC during Alzheimer's and prion diseases, and have implications upon the prospects of several promising therapeutic strategies. © 2018.

AB  - The ability to orchestrate appropriate physiological and behavioral responses to stress is important for survival, and is often dysfunctional in neuropsychiatric disorders that account for leading causes of global disability burden. Numerous studies have shown that the endocannabinoid neurotransmitter system is able to regulate stress responses and could serve as a therapeutic target for the management of these disorders. We used quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions to show that genes encoding enzymes that synthesize (abhd4, gde1, napepld), enzymes that degrade (faah, faah2a, faah2b), and receptors that bind (cnr1, cnr2, gpr55-like) endocannabinoids are expressed in zebrafish (Danio rerio). These genes are conserved in many other vertebrates, including humans, but fatty acid amide hydrolase 2 has been lost in mice and rats. We engineered transcription activator-like effector nucleases to create zebrafish with mutations in cnr1 and faah2a to test the role of these genes in modulating stress-associated behavior. We showed that disruption of cnr1 potentiated locomotor responses to hyperosmotic stress. The increased response to stress was consistent with rodent literature and served to validate the use of zebrafish in this field. Moreover, we showed for the first time that disruption of faah2a attenuated the locomotor responses to hyperosmotic stress. This later finding suggests that FAAH2 may be an important mediator of stress responses in non-rodent vertebrates. Accordingly, FAAH and FAAH2 modulators could provide distinct therapeutic options for stress-aggravated disorders. © 2018 Krug et al.

AB  - Here we show that the feeding regimen modulates zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavior. With regard to the time elapsed between feeding and behavioral evaluation, fish fed 3 h before behavioral evaluation in the novel tank test (NTT) showed decreased activity and a trend toward an anxiolytic reaction (increased use of the upper section of the aquarium) in comparison to fish fed 0.5, 6, 12, 24 or 48 h before testing, although differences were not statistically significant for all comparisons. Activity and use of the upper section of the aquarium did not differ significantly among the other treatments. Regarding feeding frequency, fish fed once a day showed higher anxiety-like behavior (decreased use of the upper section of the aquarium) in comparison to fish fed twice a day, but feeding four or six times per day or only every second day did not result in differences from feeding twice a day. Feeding frequency had no effect on activity level. Metabolically, fish fed once a day presented decreased levels of glucose and glycogen and increased lactate when compared to the regular feeding (fish fed twice a day), suggesting that feeding regimen may modulate carbohydrate metabolism. Mechanistically, we suggest that the metabolic changes caused by the feeding regimen may induce behavioral changes. Our results suggest that the high variability of the results among different laboratories might be related to different feeding protocols. Therefore, if issues pertaining to the feeding regimen are not considered during experiments with zebrafish, erroneous interpretations of datasets may occur. © 2018 Dametto et al.

AB  - Lippia alba and Aloysia triphylla essential oils (EOs) are known to contain anesthetic properties. The majority of conventional anesthetics applied to fish cause aversive behavior in these animals. Therefore, questions arise whether EOs from L. alba and A. triphylla are also aversive and if they alter anxioly-like behaviors. To answer these questions, jundiá (Rhamdia quelen) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) were studied with the preference test using 50% of the anesthetic concentration of L. alba (corresponding to 150 μL L− 1) and A. triphylla (corresponding to 150 μL L− 1) EOs and the novel tank test immediately after exposure. Cortisol analysis was also performed. We show that EOs from L. alba and A. triphylla have an anxiolytic effect on zebrafish and catfish without altering locomotor patterns or inducing aversive behavior. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first time that preference tests were applied for natural anesthetics from plant extracts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Environmental enrichment is widely used to improve welfare and behavioral performance of animal species. It ensures housing of laboratory animals in environments with space and complexity that enable the expression of their normal behavioral repertoire. Auditory enrichment by exposure to classical music decreases abnormal behaviors and endocrine stress responses in humans, non-humans primates, and rodents. However, little is known about the role of auditory enrichment in laboratory zebrafish. Given the growing importance of zebrafish for neuroscience research, such studies become critical. To examine whether auditory enrichment by classical music can affect fish behavior and physiology, we exposed adult zebrafish to 2 h of Vivaldi's music (65-75 dB) twice daily, for 15 days. Overall, zebrafish exposed to such auditory stimuli were less anxious in the novel tank test and less active, calmer in the light-dark test, also affecting zebrafish physiological (immune) biomarkers, decreasing peripheral levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing the activity of some CNS genes, without overt effects on whole-body cortisol levels. In summary, we report that twice-daily exposure to continuous musical sounds may provide benefits over the ongoing 50-55 dB background noise of equipment in the laboratory setting. Overall, our results support utilizing auditory enrichment in laboratory zebrafish to reduce stress and improve welfare in this experimental aquatic organism. © 2018 Barcellos et al.

AB  - Ethanol is one of the most commonly abused drugs and consequently its toxic and psychoactive effect has been widely investigated, although little is known about the time-dependent effects of this drug. In the present research zebrafish was used to assess daily rhythms in ethanol toxicity and behavioural effects, as well as the temporal pattern of expression of key genes involved in ethanol detoxification in the liver (adh8a, adh5, aldh2.1 and aldh2.2). Our results showed marked differences in the mortality rate of zebrafish larvae depending on the time of day of the exposure to 5% ethanol for 1h (82% and 6% mortality in the morning and at night, respectively). A significant daily rhythm was detected with the acrophase located at “zeitgeber” time (ZT) = 04:22 h. Behavioural tests exposing zebrafish to 1% ethanol provoked a major decrease in swimming activity (68–84.2% reduction) at ZT2, ZT6 and ZT10. In contrast, exposure at ZT18 stimulated swimming activity (27% increase). During the day fish moved towards the bottom of the tank during ethanol exposure, whereas at night zebrafish increased their activity levels right after the exposure to ethanol. Genes involved in ethanol detoxification failed to show significant daily rhythms in LD, although all of them exhibited circadian regulation in constant darkness (DD) with acrophases in phase and located at the end of the subjective night. Taken altogether, this research revealed the importance of considering the time of day when designing and carrying out toxicological and behavioural tests to investigate the effects of ethanol, as the adverse effects of this drug were more marked when fish were exposed in the morning than at night. © 2018 Vera et al.

AB  - Scopolamine (hyoscine) is a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist that has traditionally been used to treat motion sickness in humans. However, studies investigating depressed and bipolar populations have found that scopolamine is also effective at reducing depression and anxiety symptoms. The potential anxiety-reducing (anxiolytic) effects of scopolamine could have great clinical implications for humans; however, rats and mice administered scopolamine showed increased anxiety in standard behavioural tests. This is in direct contrast to findings in humans, and complicates studies to elucidate the specific mechanisms of scopolamine action. The aim of this study was to assess the suitability of zebrafish as a model system to test anxiety-like compounds using scopolamine. Similar to humans, scopolamine acted as an anxiolytic in individual behavioural tests (novel approach test and novel tank diving test). The anxiolytic effect of scopolamine was dose dependent and biphasic, reaching maximum effect at 800 μM. Scopolamine (800 μM) also had an anxiolytic effect in a group behavioural test, as it significantly decreased their tendency to shoal. These results establish zebrafish as a model organism for studying the anxiolytic effects of scopolamine, its mechanisms of action and side effects. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The use of zebrafish models to study central nervous system aging and late-onset neurological diseases will be facilitated by assays allowing rapid evaluation of neurological phenotypes in adult zebrafish. We analyzed groups of 12 adult zebrafish swimming simultaneously in single-animal arenas, and quantified their responses to changes in ambient illumination. Under these conditions, stereotypical locomotor patterns were observed and readily quantified using open source software. Continuous, low-velocity movements were observed during 10-min periods of darkness, whereas intermittent high-velocity movements occurred in bright light. At 80%-90% of abrupt light-to-dark or dark-to-light transitions, adult zebrafish produced a synchronous short-latency (20-22 ms) turn, followed by a propulsive movement with a high transient maximum velocity (400-500 mm/s). Between 5 and 35 months of age, latency increased by ∼10%, and peak velocity decreased by ∼30%, suggesting that the response declines in aged adults. Light transition responses can be measured rapidly and automatically in multiple adult zebrafish simultaneously, providing a convenient quantitative method for evaluating sensorimotor function in adult zebrafish models of neurological disease. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.

AB  - The study of zebrafish behavior represents a cornerstone upon which basic researchers promise to advance knowledge in life sciences. Although zebrafish swim in a three-dimensional (3D) space, their behavior in the lab is almost exclusively scored in two dimensions, whereby zebrafish are recorded using a single camera providing 2D videos. Whether this dimensional reduction preserves the reliability of data has not been addressed. Here we show that, compared to a 3D observation, 2D data are flawed by over-reporting and under-reporting of locomotory differences. Specifically, we first reconstructed 3D trajectories through the integration of synchronous information derived from two cameras, and then compared them with the original 2D views in classical experimental paradigms assessing shoaling tendency, fear, anxiety, and general locomotion. Our results suggest that traditional behavioral scoring of individual zebrafish performed in 2D may undermine data integrity, thereby requiring a general reconsideration of scoring zebrafish behavior to incorporate a 3D approach. We then demonstrate that, compared to 2D, a 3D approach requires a reduced number of subjects to achieve the same degree of validity. We anticipate these findings to largely benefit animal welfare by reducing the number of experimental subjects, without affecting statistical power. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Interactions between conspecifics early in life have the potential to shape phenotypic differences between individuals. These changes in phenotype may subsequently be passed to future offspring, something that has been studied in live-bearing mammals where there is often an element of parental care. The present study considers the transgenerational effects of social environment in zebrafish, Danio rerio, an egg-laying animal that shows no parental care, thus removing any influence of parental interaction and allowing the effects of conspecific interaction to be clearly determined. Zebrafish (F0) were reared from fertilization to reproduction in three different social treatments: isolation, groups of 30 or groups of 100. At 28 days post fertilization, individuals were tested for anxiety and activity and at 3 months old for aggression. These F0 fish were raised to sexual maturity and bred within their treatment group. The F1 generation were then raised in groups of 30, irrespective of parental social environment and were assessed for behaviour in the same way as their parents. Social isolation increased anxiety and decreased aggression in the F0 fish compared to those raised in social groups of 100. F0 fish raised in social groups of 30 showed an intermediate response. Differences in anxiety were not passed to the F1 generation; however, offspring of socially isolated fish were less aggressive than offspring of parents from social groups of 30 and 100. The social environment that an individual experienced from fertilization to reproduction affected their own behaviour and the behaviour of their offspring. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB  - Incorporation of chemometric tools in behavioural data management workflows allows for the early identification of most relevant endpoints complementarily to statistical confirmatory approaches. In this work, the effects of two model neurotoxicants, chlorpyrifos (CPF) and nicotine, exposures on behavioural profiles of adult zebrafish at three different times (2, 6 and 24 h) were evaluated using open field test (OFT) paradigm experiments. Two chemometric methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Analysis of Variance-Simultaneous Component Analysis (ASCA) have been used to interpret the changes observed in the obtained behavioural data. A decreased of the locomotor activity, an anxiolytic effect and an altered exploratory behaviour were the most affected behavioural endpoints in the CPF exposures. However, an increase of the locomotor activity and an anxiogenic effect were observed in the nicotine exposures. Finally, an excellent correlation between the ASCA results and the results obtained using traditional statistical procedures for both compounds were encountered. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study aimed to characterize the metazoan parasitic fauna associated with freshwater farmed ornamental fish in Southern Brazil. Between July 2014 and January 2015, a total of 423 fish belonging to nine species were examined: Pterophylum scalare, Betta splendens, two varieties of Carassius auratus, Danio rerio, Xiphophorus helleri, two varieties of Xiphophorus maculatus, Poecilia sphenops, Tanichthys albonubes and Puntius sachsii. In each fish collection, the water quality parameters were measured. Specimens were obtained from three ornamental fish farms located in three micro-regions in the State of Santa Catarina (Araquari, Biguaçu and Camboriú). Parasitological indexes were obtained after qualitative and quantitative parasitological analysis. Monogenean parasites, nematodes, and cestodes were found in all facilities. Nevertheless, nematodes and monogeneans presented 100% of prevalence in P. scalare from Araquari. From the analyzed species, P. scalare showed the highest parasite richness. © 2017, Escuela de Ciencias del Mar. All rights reserved.

AB  - Feed deprivation has deleterious effects on fish behavior and stress physiology which may susceptible them to disease outbreak. Functional ingredients in diets may substantially impact the physiology and stress responses of host organisms. Here, we hypothesized that the administration of a dietary prebiotic might attenuate the negative influences of feed deprivation on the behavioral profile of anxiety and physiological responses to stress in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Fish were fed with either basal or mannan-oligosaccharide supplemented (0.4% MOS/kg diet) diets, once per day (normal-control: CN, and normal-prebiotic: PN) or once every other day (starved-control: CS, and starved-prebiotic: PS) for 8 weeks. Afterwards, fish were subjected to a novel tank test to measure anxiety. Fish from the CS treatment exhibited more pronounced bottom-dwelling behavior than the other treatments. The number of transitions from the bottom to the top third of the novel tank was significantly higher in PN fish than the CS specimens. No significant differences were found between the CN and PS treatments in all of the anxiety behaviors. CS fish showed higher baseline cortisol levels than the other treatments, which was in line with higher expression of CRH gene in fish subjected to this treatment. Cortisol levels and CRH gene expression of the subjects were also measured after induction of two routine aquaculture stressors. CN and PS fish exhibited similar patterns of cortisol responses at most of the sampling times after stress, and PN specimens showed a significantly lower concentration of cortisol than the other treatments in most cases. Expression of the CRH gene was higher in feed deprived fish immediately after stress induction. Overall, the results show that feed deprivation in some cases influenced anxiety-like behaviors and elevated stress response in zebrafish juveniles; however, the addition of MOS to the diet helped deprived fish exhibit behaviors more typical of normally fed animals. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) can be used in studies addressing the effects of drugs on learning, memory, and anxiety. In the present study, we investigated the effect of different alcohol treatments (chronic and acute) on the learning and anxiety response of zebrafish in an inhibitory avoidance paradigm. Zebrafish were initially exposed to different alcohol treatments and submitted to an inhibitory avoidance protocol, where an electroshock was applied to the fish as they swam from the white to the black side of a shuttle box tank (naturally preferred environment of zebrafish). Animals from the control and 0.5% acute alcohol groups exhibited high latency to enter the black side of the tank after the first exposure to electroshock, in addition to higher freezing and a shorter distance from the bottom of the tank, suggesting acute alcohol exposure did not affect aversive learning in zebrafish. However, chronic exposure and alcohol withdrawal impaired the fish's capacity to properly respond to the aversive stimulus. Overall, our results show the harmful effects of chronic alcohol exposure, both continued intake and its cessation, but avoidance behavior persisted and anxiety increased following acute alcohol exposure. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc..

AB  - Behavioral responses are shaped by a complex interplay of extrinsic factors, such as predation and flow conditions, and intrinsic properties such as metabolic state. We investigated variations in boldness among four populations of zebrafish collected from widely varying habitat conditions across India. We measured feeding latencies of fish in four contexts: in a novel environment; in an environment with refuge and predators; in the presence of a shoal; and in the presence of a shoal and predators. The population from a high-flow and high-predation habitat was significantly bolder than populations from low-predation and low-flow/stagnant habitats. Individuals were significantly bolder in the presence of shoal and predators than in the other contexts. In general, males were significantly bolder than females. Smaller individuals took greater risks to feed than larger individuals only within two populations. The high-predation, high-flow habitat fish also showed significantly lower between- and within-individual variation in boldness than all the low-predation and low-flow populations. Furthermore, we found significantly repeatable responses across contexts within all populations, indicating behavioral consistency. Differences in response to variations in experimental contexts and stress and individual differences in metabolic rates could possibly explain the observed between- and within-individual variation among populations. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc..

AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become an excellent tool to study mental health disorders, due to its physiological and genetic similarity to humans, ease of genetic manipulation, and feasibility of small molecule screening. Zebrafish have been shown to exhibit characteristics of addiction to drugs of abuse in non-contingent assays, including conditioned place preference, but contingent assays have been limited to a single assay for alcohol consumption. Using inexpensive electronic, mechanical, and optical components, we developed an automated opioid self-administration assay for zebrafish, enabling us to measure drug seeking and gain insight into the underlying biological pathways. Zebrafish trained in the assay for five days exhibited robust self-administration, which was dependent on the function of the μ-opioid receptor. In addition, a progressive ratio protocol was used to test conditioned animals for motivation. Furthermore, conditioned fish continued to seek the drug despite an adverse consequence and showed signs of stress and anxiety upon withdrawal of the drug. Finally, we validated our assay by confirming that self-administration in zebrafish is dependent on several of the same molecular pathways as in other animal models. Given the ease and throughput of this assay, it will enable identification of important biological pathways regulating drug seeking and could lead to the development of new therapeutic molecules to treat addiction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Alcohol exposure in adolescence is a contributing factor toward reward-seeking behavior in adulthood. This reward-seeking behavior is assessed in animal models using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. In this study, ethanol-induced change in time spent by zebrafish on the initially non-preferred tank side was studied by conditioning adult zebrafish to ethanol dissolved in water (0.00% 1.00%; 1.25%; 1.50%; 1.60%; 1.75% vol/vol) paired with an initially non-preferred environment. Following a single conditioning cycle, fish swam unrestricted in the CPP chamber to assess changes in preference. Daily 20-min pre-exposure to ethanol for 1 week during the juvenile stage starting at either 20 days post fertilization (dpf) or 40 dpf altered percent time spent on the ethanol-paired side in adulthood in a dose-dependent and sex-dependent manner. The results suggest that male and female zebrafish are an effective model in which to investigate behavioral correlates of ethanol-induced changes in neural circuits implicated in reward and anxiety. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Circadian regulation of hepatic detoxification seems to be amongst the key roles of the biological clock. The liver is the major site for biotransformation, and in mammals, it contains several clock-controlled transcription factors such as proline and acidic amino acid-rich basic leucine zipper proteins (PAR bZIP) and basic-helix-loop-helix Per–Arnt–Sim (bHLH–PAS) family that act as circadian regulators of detoxification genes. This investigation explored the existence of daily and circadian expression of transcription factors involved in detoxification, as well as the temporal profile of a set of their target genes in zebrafish liver. In our study, zebrafish were able to synchronize to a light-dark (LD) cycle and displayed a diurnal pattern of activity. In addition, the expression of clock genes presented daily and circadian rhythmicity in liver. Apart from hlfa, the expression of PAR bZIP transcription factors also displayed daily rhythms, which appeared to be both light-dependent and clock-controlled, as circadian rhythms free-ran under constant conditions (continuous darkness, DD). Under LD, tefb, dbpa and dbpb expression peaked at the end of the darkness period whereas tefa showed peak levels of expression at the onset of the photophase. In addition, these four genes exhibited circadian expression under DD, with higher expression levels at the end of the subjective night. The expression of the bHLH-PAS transcription factor arh2 also showed circadian rhythmicity in zebrafish liver, peaking in the middle of the subjective night and approximately 3–4 h before peak expression of the PAR bZIP genes. Regarding the detoxification genes, the major target gene of AhR, cyp1a, showed daily and circadian expression with an acrophase 2 h after ahr2. Under LD, abcb4 also showed daily rhythmicity, with an acrophase 1–2 h after that of PAR bZIP factors during the transition between darkness and light phases, when zebrafish become active. However, the expression of six detoxification genes showed circadian rhythmicity under DD, including cyp1a and abcb4 as well as gstr1, mgst3a, abcg2 and sult2_st2. In all cases, the acrophases of these genes were found during the second half of the subjective night, in phase with the PAR bZIP transcription factors. This suggested that their expression is clock-controlled, either directly by core clock genes or through transcription factors. This study presents new data demonstrating that the process of detoxification is under circadian control in fish. Results showed that time of day should be considered when designing toxicological studies or administering drugs to fish. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Exposure to ethanol during critical period of development can cause severe impairments in the central nervous system (CNS). This study was conducted to assess the neurotoxic effects of chronic embryonic exposure to ethanol in the zebrafish, taking into consideration the time dependent effect. Two types of exposure regimen were applied in this study. Withdrawal exposure group received daily exposure starting from gastrulation until hatching, while continuous exposure group received daily exposure from gastrulation until behavioural assessment at 6 dpf (days post fertilization). Chronic embryonic exposure to ethanol decreased spontaneous tail coiling at 24 hpf (hour post fertilization), heart rate at 48 hpf and increased mortality rate at 72 hpf. The number of apoptotic cells in the embryos treated with ethanol was significantly increased as compared to the control. We also measured the morphological abnormalities and the most prominent effects can be observed in the treated embryos exposed to 1.50% and 2.00%. The treated embryos showed shorter body length, larger egg yolk, smaller eye diameter and heart edema as compared to the control. Larvae received 0.75% continuous ethanol exposure exhibited decreased swimming activity and increased anxiety related behavior, while withdrawal ethanol exposure showed increased swimming activity and decreased anxiety related behavior as compared to the respective control. Biochemical analysis exhibited that ethanol exposure for both exposure regimens altered proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids of the zebrafish larvae. Our results indicated that time dependent effect of ethanol exposure during development could target the biochemical processes thus leading to induction of apoptosis and neurobehavioral deficits in the zebrafish larvae. Thus it raised our concern about the safe limit of alcohol consumption for pregnant mother especially during critical periods of vulnerability for developing nervous system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and its derivatives, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromo-amphetamine hydrobromide (DOB) and para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA), are recreational drugs whose pharmacological effects have recently been attributed to serotonin 5HT2A/C receptors. However, there is growing evidence that the oxytocin (OT)/vasopressin system can modulate some the effects of MDMA. In this study, MDMA (2.5–10 mg/kg), DOB (0.5 mg/kg), or PMA (0.005, 0.1, or 0.25 mg/kg) were administered intramuscularly to adult zebra fish, alone or in combination with the V1a vasopressin antagonist, SR49059 (0.01–1 ng/kg), before carrying out conditioned place preference (CPP), social preference, novel tank diving, and light–dark tests in order to evaluate subsequent rewarding, social, and emotional-like behavior. The combination of SR49059 and each drug progressively blocked: (1) rewarding behavior as measured by CPP in terms of time spent in drug-paired compartment; (2) prosocial effects measured on the basis of the time spent in the proximity of a nacre fish picture; and (3) anxiolytic effects in terms of the time spent in the upper half of the novel tank and in the white compartment of the tank used for the light–dark test. Antagonism was obtained at SR49059 doses which, when given alone, did not change motor function. In comparison with a control group, receiving vehicle alone, there was a three to five times increase in the brain release of isotocin (the analog of OT in fish) after treatment with the most active doses of MDMA (10 mg/kg), DOB (0.5 mg/kg), and PMA (0.1 mg/kg) as evaluated by means of bioanalytical reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Taken together, these findings show that the OT/vasopressin system is involved in the rewarding, prosocial, and anxiolytic effects of MDMA, DOB, and PMA in zebra fish and underline the association between this system and the behavioral alterations associated with disorders related to substance abuse. © 2017 Ponzoni, Braida, Bondiolotti and Sala.

AB  - In species in which individuals live in stable social groups, individual recognition is expected to evolve to allow individuals to remember past interactions with different individuals and adjust future behavior toward them accordingly. Thus, social memory is expected to be a ubiquitous component of social cognition of social species. However, few studies have investigated the occurrence of social memory in non-mammals. Here we evaluated the ability of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to recognize different conspecifics and to retain this information in long lasting (i.e. 24 h) memories. We used a social discrimination paradigm, adapted from mouse studies, in which the focal individual meets two pairs of conspecifics in two consecutive days: one conspecific is the same in both days and the other is different between days 1 and 2. If animals have the ability to discriminate between different conspecifics, it is predicted that they will spend more time exploring the novel than the familiar (i.e. already seen in day 1) conspecific. In this study, zebrafish with access to both olfactory and visual conspecific cues exhibited consistent recognition of a previously encountered (familiar) conspecific after a 24 h delay. This result supports the hypothesis that long-term social memory, previously described in mammals, is also present in zebrafish, hence extending the evidence for the presence of this type of memory to teleost fish. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance Maerua angolensis DC (Capparaceae) has been employed in the management of several central nervous system (CNS) disorders including anxiety. This study evaluated the anxiolytic effects of the petroleum ether/ethyl acetate fraction stem bark extract and its possible mechanism(s) using zebrafish anxiety models. Methods Adult zebrafish, tested in the novel tank and light dark tests, have shown by previous authors to be sensitive to the anxiolytic effects of known anxiolytic drugs. Adult zebrafish were treated with M. angolensis extract, fluoxetine, desipramine, and diazepam followed by testing in the novel tank and light dark tests. We further assessed the effect of the extract on anxiety after inducing an anxiogenic phenotype using the ethanol-withdrawal and chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) tests. The anxiolytic effect was further investigated after pretreatment with flumazenil, granisetron, cyproheptadine, methysergide and pizotifen. Results M. angolensis extract, similar to fluoxetine and desipramine, demonstrated significant anxiolytic behaviour at doses that did not reduce locomotor activity significantly. Similar anxiolytic effects were recorded in the ethanol withdrawal-induced anxiety test. Furthermore, the anxiogenic effects induced by the CUS paradigm were significantly reversed by treatment M. angolensis extract and fluoxetine. The anxiolytic effects of M. angolensis extract were however reversed after pre-treatment with flumazenil, granisetron, cyproheptadine, methysergide and pizotifen. Conclusions Taken together, this suggests that the petroleum ether/ ethyl acetate fraction of M. angolensis possesses significant anxiolytic activity, which could partly be accounted for by an interaction with the serotoninergic system and the GABAA receptor. © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

AB  - Noribogaine is the main psychoactive metabolite of the hallucinogenic drug ibogaine, and is a particularly interesting compound potentially useful to treat dependence and various psychiatric disorders. Here, we report the effects of noribogaine on anxiety and locomotion in zebrafish (Danio rerio), a new promising model organism in neurobehavioral and psychopharmacological research. Adult zebrafish were subjected to the 5 min novel tank test (NTT) following an acute, 20-min drug immersion in 1, 5 and 10 mg/L noribogaine. Overall, noribogaine produced robust anxiolytic-like behavior in zebrafish (increasing the time spent and transitions to the top half compartment and reducing freezing bouts) without overt effects on fish locomotion. Taken together, these results indicate that noribogaine modulates the components of the acute stress response related to emotionality and anxiety behaviors, implicating this drug as a potentially useful non-sedative anxiolytic agent. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The light–dark preference test has been extensively used to screen anxiolytic drugs and investigate mechanisms of anxiety with rodents. Recently, this task has been adapted to zebrafish, but a number of inconsistent findings have emerged. For example, some found zebrafish to avoid and others to prefer dark. Given the translational relevance of the zebrafish, its utility in high throughput drug screens, and that anxiety still represents a large unmet medical need, there is an urgent need to resolve these inconsistencies. We propose these inconsistencies are due to lack of distinction between two separate factorsbackground shade and level of illumination. Here, we systematically manipulated background shade (black vs. white) while keeping the illumination level constant (uniformly illuminated). We also manipulated the level of illumination (illuminated vs. not illuminated) while keeping the background constant (either uniformly black or white). We examined the time-course of numerous behavioural responses under these conditions, and found zebrafish to exhibit a significant preference for the black side of the tank within the first 3 min of the test when the illumination level was constant. We found this response, along with other anxiety-like behaviours, to diminish over time. In contrast, we found zebrafish did not exhibit a preference for the unilluminated (dark) side of the tank when the background shade was kept constant. Our results demonstrate a dissociation between illumination level and background shade, shown by a preference for black to white, but not for dark to light, confirming the importance of differentiating these two distinct factors. © 2017

AB  - Changes in the expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT), or the sensitivity of dopamine receptors, are associated with aging and substance abuse and may underlie some of the symptoms common to both conditions. In this study, we explored the role of the dopaminergic system in the anxiogenic effects of aging and acute cocaine exposure by comparing the behavioral phenotypes of wild type (WT) and DAT knockout zebrafish (DAT-KO) of different ages. To determine the involvement of specific dopamine receptors in anxiety states, antagonists to D1 (SCH23390) and D2/D3 (sulpiride) were employed. We established that DAT-KO results in a chronic anxiety-like state, seen as an increase in bottom-dwelling and thigmotaxis. Similar effects were produced by aging and acute cocaine administration, both leading to reduction in DAT mRNA abundance (qPCR). Inhibition of D1 activity counteracted the anxiety-like effects associated with DAT deficit, independent of its origin. Inhibition of D2/D3 receptors reduced anxiety in young DAT-KO, and enhanced the anxiogenic effects of cocaine in WT, but did not affect aged WT or DAT-KO fish. These findings provide new evidence that the dopaminergic system plays a critical role in anxiety-like states, and suggest that adult zebrafish provide a sensitive diurnal vertebrate model for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of anxiety and a platform for anxiolytic drug screens. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Our present research aimed to perform a detailed behavioral characterization of caffeine-induced seizure activity in zebrafish. Epileptic activity was observed by immersing individuals in different concentrations of caffeine solution at 250, 350, and 500 mg/l, respectively. Higher concentrations of caffeine rapidly induced intense behavioral activity resembling tonic seizures. Lower concentrations resulted in behavior that was less intense but sustained for longer periods. Significant attenuation of seizure severity was observed in zebrafish pretreated with the barbiturate phenobarbitone. Finally, brain caffeine levels were measured using HPLC-UV methodology in fish immersed in different concentrations of caffeine. Brain caffeine levels increased with higher concentrations of caffeine treatment; however, they were not significantly altered by pretreatment with phenobarbitone. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ISPA.

AB  - The anticonvulsant drug ethosuximide has shown diverse anxiety-related activity in rodents, but research in zebrafish is limited. To evaluate the effects of acute ethosuximide exposure on locomotor activity and anxiety-related thigmotaxis behaviours of zebrafish larvae, the activity of AB strain zebrafish larvae at 5 and 7 days postfertilization (dpf) was analysed under normal constant illumination and stressful light-dark transitions. Under constant illumination, ethosuximide at concentrations of 2, 5 and 10 mmol/l increased the distances travelled and intensified locomotor responses to a novel environment. In addition, 40 mmol/l ethosuximide decreased the travel distance and attenuated the locomotor response to darkness. The effects were age related. Under constant illumination, ethosuximide at 40 mmol/l reduced thigmotaxis behaviours in larvae at both ages. Under the light-dark transition, 5 mmol/l ethosuximide reduced thigmotaxis behaviours in 7-dpf larvae. We concluded that under constant lighting, ethosuximide at low concentrations (2, 5 and 10 mmol/l) stimulated the locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae, whereas a high concentration (40 mmol/l) inhibited the activity. Ethosuximide at a low concentration (5 mmol/l) showed anxiolytic effects during the stressful light-dark transition in 7-dpf larvae. The effects of ethosuximide were age and concentration related. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - There is increasing recognition of the importance of early-life environmental exposures in health disorders at later-life stages. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether early-life exposure to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) could induce neurodegenerative syndromes at later-life stages in zebrafish. Embryos were exposed to BaP at doses of 0, 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50nM from early embryogenesis to 96h post-fertilization (hpf), then transferred to clean water and maintained for 365 days. We found that BaP decreased locomotor and cognitive ability, neurotransmitter levels of dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and norepinephrine; and induced loss of dopaminergic neurons and resulted in neurodegeneration. Additionally, BaP increased amyloid β protein and cell apoptosis in the adult zebrafish brain. Further, DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNMT3a were up-regulated in 96 hpf larvae and the adult brain. MeDIP-sequencing data of the 96 hpf larvae identified 235 differentially methylated genes in promoter, with the fold change > 1.5. Guanylate cyclase 2F (gucy2f) and dopamine receptor D4 related sequence (drd4-rs) were hypermethylation promoters, whereas zinc finger C4H2 domain (zc4h2) was a hypomethylation promoter in 96 hpf larvae and the adult brain. The mRNA levels of gucy2f and drd4-rs were down-regulated, and zc4h2 was up-regulated. Our findings suggested that the lasting modifications of DNA methylation were associated with neurodegenerative syndromes in adult zebrafish as a result of early-life BaP exposure. © The Author 2017.

AB  - The synthetic estrogen 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) is an endocrine disrupting compound of concern due to its persistence and widespread presence in the aquatic environment. Effects of developmental exposure to low concentrations of EE2 in fish on reproduction and behavior not only persisted to adulthood, but have also been observed to be transmitted to several generations of unexposed progeny. To investigate the possible biological mechanisms of the persistent anxiogenic phenotype, we exposed zebrafish embryos for 80 days post fertilization to 0, 3, and 10ng/L EE2 (measured concentrations 2.14 and 7.34ng/L). After discontinued exposure, the animals were allowed to recover for 120 days in clean water. Adult males and females were later tested for changes in stress response and shoal cohesion, and whole-brain gene expression was analyzed with RNA sequencing. The results show increased anxiety in the novel tank and scototaxis tests, and increased shoal cohesion in fish exposed during development to EE2. RNA sequencing revealed 34 coding genes differentially expressed in male brains and 62 in female brains as a result of EE2 exposure. Several differences were observed between males and females in differential gene expression, with only one gene, sv2b, coding for a synaptic vesicle protein, that was affected by EE2 in both sexes. Functional analyses showed that in female brains, EE2 had significant effects on pathways connected to the circadian rhythm, cytoskeleton and motor proteins and synaptic proteins. A large number of non-coding sequences including 19 novel miRNAs were also differentially expressed in the female brain. The largest treatment effect in male brains was observed in pathways related to cholesterol biosynthesis and synaptic proteins. Circadian rhythm and cholesterol biosynthesis, previously implicated in anxiety behavior, might represent possible candidate pathways connecting the transcriptome changes to the alterations to behavior. Further the observed alteration in expression of genes involved in synaptogenesis and synaptic function may be important for the developmental modulations resulting in an anxiety phenotype. This study represents an initial survey of the fish brain transcriptome by RNA sequencing after long-termrecovery fromdevelopmental exposure to an estrogenic compound. © 2017 Porseryd, Volkova, Reyhanian Caspillo, Källman, Dinnetz and Porsh Hällström.

AB  - Zebrafish have become a popular animal model for behavioural pharmacology due to their small size, rapid development, and amenability to high throughput behavioural drug screens. Furthermore, water-soluble compounds can be administered via immersion of the fish in the drug solution, which provides a non-invasive drug delivery method. Numerous studies have demonstrated stimulant effects of alcohol. Diazepam and caffeine, on the other hand have been found to have inhibitory effect on locomotor activity in zebrafish. However, the time-dependent changes induced by these psychoactive drugs are rarely reported, and potential drug interactions have not been examined in zebrafish, despite the translational relevance of this question. In the current study, we examine time- and dose-dependent changes in zebrafish following exposure to caffeine, diazepam, and ethanol quantifying four different behavioural parameters over a 30 min recording session. We subsequently analyze potential drug-drug interactions by co-administering the three drugs in different combinations. Our time-course and dose-response analyses for each of the three drugs represent so far the most detailed studies available serving as a foundation for future psychopharmacology experiments with zebrafish. Furthermore, we report significant interactions between the three drugs corroborating findings obtained with rodent models as well as in humans, providing translational relevance for the zebrafish model. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A study was designed to investigate the possible positive prebiotic effects of mannan oligosaccharides (MOS) on growth and reduction of anxiety behaviors in zebrafish (Danio rerio). The experimental diets were supplemented with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 g MOS kg−1 and were fed to juvenile fish (0.47 ± 0.017 g) in triplicates for six weeks. Significant differences were found in the final body weight, body weight intake, percent body weight intake, and specific growth rate among treatments. The regression analyses showed that the optimum MOS level was 4–4.1 g MOS kg−1 diet. Fish fed 4 g MOS kg−1 feed showed higher survival than the other treatments. Also, using the novel tank test, fish fed with 4 g MOS kg−1 diet showed lower anxiety by swimming in the upper portion of the tank. The other behavior parameters remained unaffected by the prebiotic. The results indicated the beneficial effect of the prebiotic MOS on growth and partly on welfare of zebrafish juveniles. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of caffeine in the behavioral and inflammatory alterations caused by copper in zebrafish larvae, attempting to correlate these changes with the modulation of adenosine receptors. To perform a survival curve, 7 dpf larvae were exposed to 10 μM CuSO4, combined to different concentrations of caffeine (100 μM, 500 μM and 1 mM) for up to 24 h. The treatment with copper showed lower survival rates only when combined with 500 μM and 1 mM of caffeine. We selected 4 and 24 h as treatment time-points. The behavior evaluation was done by analyzing the traveled distance, the number of entries in the center, and the length of permanence in the center and the periphery of the well. The exposure to 10 μM CuSO4 plus 500 μM caffeine at 4 and 24 h changed the behavioral parameters. To study the inflammatory effects of caffeine, we assessed the PGE2 levels by using UHPLC-MS/MS, and TNF, COX-2, IL-6 and IL-10 gene expression by RT-qPCR. The expression of adenosine receptors was also evaluated with RT-qPCR. When combined to copper, caffeine altered inflammatory markers depending on the time of exposure. Adenosine receptors expression was significantly increased, especially after 4 h exposure to copper and caffeine together or separately. Our results demonstrated that caffeine enhances the inflammation induced by copper by decreasing animal survival, altering inflammatory markers and promoting behavioral changes in zebrafish larvae. We also conclude that alterations in adenosine receptors are related to those effects. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Zebrafish have become a popular animal model for studying the development of alcohol addiction. Several behavioral paradigms for studying alcohol addiction have been developed for zebrafish, including conditioned place preference, alcohol-induced tolerance, and withdrawal. However, alcohol choice preference tasks have not been established in zebrafish as of yet. The ability of zebrafish to detect alcohol in their environment is required in alcohol choice or preference tasks. To our knowledge, it is currently unknown whether zebrafish are able to detect alcohol in their environment immediately following bath immersion. In the current study, we analyzed the time course of alcohol-induced behavioral changes of zebrafish while being immersed in alcohol solution in a 1.5 L tank. We recorded each trial in high-definition and quantified behavioral responses using automated video tracking-based and manual observation-based methods to quantify temporal changes in alcohol-induced behaviors. As alcohol is known to require several minutes of bath immersion to reach the brain in zebrafish, we argued that behavioral responses before this time point would prove zebrafish's ability to detect this substance in the water. Our results show that a 60-min exposure to 1% alcohol alters behavioral responses in a time-dependent manner. Notably, alcohol exposure significantly increased absolute turn angle, decreased distance to bottom, and variance of distance to bottom within the first 3 min immediately following exposure, a response that occurred before alcohol could reach the brain of the subjects in measurable amounts. These results imply that zebrafish are able to detect alcohol in their environment immediately following immersion into the drug solution.

AB  - Zebrafish were exposed through diet to two environmentally relevant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) mixtures of contrasted compositions, one of pyrolytic (PY) origin and one from light crude oil (LO). Monoamine concentrations were quantified in the brains of the fish after six month of exposure. A significant decrease in noradrenaline (NA) was observed in fish exposed to both mixtures, while a decrease in serotonin (5HT) and dopamine (DA) was observed only in LO-exposed fish. A decrease in metabolites of 5HT and DA was observed in fish exposed to both mixtures. Several behavioural disruptions were observed that depended on mixtures, and parallels were made with changes in monoamine concentrations. Indeed, we observed an increase in anxiety in fish exposed to both mixtures, which could be related to the decrease in 5HT and/or NA, while disruptions of daily activity rhythms were observed in LO fish, which could be related to the decrease in DA. Taken together, these results showed that (i) chronic exposures to PAHs mixtures disrupted brain monoamine contents, which could underlie behavioural disruptions, and that (ii) the biological responses depended on mixture compositions. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, we observed the effect of sound, predatory and new enviroment on zebrafish behavior to determine which factor gives the most effect on the fish. Elevation of stress was observed on fishes that were moved consecutively into a container. Interestingly, this does not impair the fish feeding activity, even with the presence of a predator. Transfering of fish into different size of container also did not change the level of stress and anxiety in the fish. Zebrafish were also shown to have high cognitive ability to adapt to new sound condition in the enviroment, prefering constant and slow tempo compared to fast and erratic tempo. In conclusion, external environment such as sound and transfering of fish were able to effect fish behavior. © 2017, Malaysian Society of Applied Biology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Olfaction plays a key role in modulating behavioral and physiological responses of various animal species, including fishes. Olfactory deficits can be induced in fish experimentally, and utilized to examine the role of olfaction in their normal and pathological behaviors. Here, we examine whether experimental anosmia, evoked by ZnSO4 in adult zebrafish can be associated with behavioral and/or physiological responses. We show that experimental ZnSO4-induced anosmia caused acute, but not prolonged, anxiogenic-like effects on zebrafish behavior tested in the novel tank test. The procedure also elevated whole-body cortisol levels in zebrafish. Moreover, ZnSO4 treatment, but not sham, produced damage to olfactory epithelium, inducing overt basal cell vacuolization and intercellular edema. The loss of olfaction, assessed by the fish food preference behavior in the aquatic Y-maze, was present 1 h, but not 24 h, after the treatment. Collectively, this suggests that transient experimental anosmia by ZnSO4 modulates zebrafish behavior and olfaction, which can be used to evoke and assess their stress-related anxiety-like states. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Keeping identity for a long term after occlusion is still an open problem in the video tracking of zebrafish-like model animals, and accurate animal trajectories are the foundation of behaviour analysis. We utilize the highly accurate object recognition capability of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to distinguish fish of the same congener, even though these animals are indistinguishable to the human eye. We used data augmentation and an iterative CNN training method to optimize the accuracy for our classification task, achieving surprisingly accurate trajectories of zebrafish of different size and age zebrafish groups over different time spans. This work will make further behaviour analysis more reliable. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - It has been shown that zebrafish fear learning proceeds in the same way as reported for rodents. However, in zebrafish fear learning it is possible to substitute the use of electric shocks as unconditioned stimulus and utilize the inborn fear responses to the alarm substance Schreckstoff, instead. The skin extract Schreckstoff elicits typical fear reactions such as preferred bottom dwelling, swimming in a tighter shoal, erratic movements and freezing. This natural fear behavior can be transferred from Schreckstoff to any other sensory stimulus by associative conditioning (fear learning). We presented Schreckstoff simultaneously with a red light stimulus and tested the effectiveness of fear learning during memory retrieval. The two brain regions known to be relevant for learning in zebrafish are the medial and the lateral pallium of the dorsal telencephalon, both containing rich expressions of the endocannabinoid receptor CB1. To test the influence of the zebrafish endocannabinoid system on fear acquisition learning, an experimental group of ten fish was pretreated with the CB1 receptor agonist THC (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol; 100 nM for 1 h). We found that CB1 activation significantly inhibited acquisition of fear learning, possibly by impairing stimulus encoding processes in pallial areas. This was supported by analyzes of c-Fos expression in the brains of experimental animals. Schreckstoff exposure during fear acquisition learning and memory retrieval during red light presentation increased the number of labelled cells in pallial structures, but in no other brain region investigated (e.g. striatum, thalamus, and habenula). THC administration before fear conditioning significantly decreased c-Fos expression in these structures to a level similar to the control group without Schreckstoff experience, suggesting that Schreckstoff induced fear learning requires brain circuits restricted mainly to pallial regions of the dorsal telencephalon. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Zebrafish is emerging as a species of choice for the study of a number of biomechanics problems, including balance development, schooling, and neuromuscular transmission. The precise quantification of the flow physics around swimming zebrafish is critical toward a mechanistic understanding of the complex swimming style of this fresh-water species. Although previous studies have elucidated the vortical structures in the wake of zebrafish swimming in placid water, the flow physics of zebrafish swimming against a water current remains unexplored. In an effort to illuminate zebrafish swimming in a dynamic environment reminiscent of its natural habitat, we experimentally investigated the locomotion and hydrodynamics of a single zebrafish swimming in a miniature water tunnel using particle image velocimetry. Our results on zebrafish locomotion detail the role of flow speed on tail beat undulations, heading direction, and swimming speed. Our findings on zebrafish hydrodynamics offer a precise quantification of vortex shedding during zebrafish swimming and demonstrate that locomotory patterns play a central role on the flow physics. This knowledge may help clarify the evolutionary advantage of burst and cruise swimming movements in zebrafish. © 2017 Mwaffo et al.

AB  - Psychiatric disorders arise due to an interplay of genetic and environmental factors, including stress. Studies in rodents have shown that mutants for Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1), a well-accepted genetic risk factor for mental illness, display abnormal behaviours in response to stress, but the mechanisms through which DISC1 affects stress responses remain poorly understood. Using two lines of zebrafish homozygous mutant for disc1, we investigated behaviour and functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis, the fish equivalent of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Here, we show that the role of DISC1 in stress responses is evolutionarily conserved and that DISC1 is essential for normal functioning of the HPI axis. Adult zebrafish homozygous mutant for disc1 show aberrant behavioural responses to stress. Our studies reveal that in the embryo, disc1 is expressed in neural progenitor cells of the hypothalamus, a conserved region of the vertebrate brain that centrally controls responses to environmental stressors. In disc1 mutant embryos, proliferating rx3+hypothalamic progenitors are not maintained normally and neuronal differentiation is compromised: rx3-derived ff1b+neurons, implicated in anxiety-related behaviours, and corticotrophin releasing hormone (crh) neurons, key regulators of the stress axis, develop abnormally, and rx3-derived pomc+neurons are disorganised. Abnormal hypothalamic development is associated with dysfunctional behavioural and neuroendocrine stress responses. In contrast to wild type siblings, disc1 mutant larvae show altered crh levels, fail to upregulate cortisol levels when under stress and do not modulate shoal cohesion, indicative of abnormal social behaviour. These data indicate that disc1 is essential for normal development of the hypothalamus and for the correct functioning of the HPA/HPI axis. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is gaining popularity as a laboratory organism and is used to model many human diseases. Many behavioural measures of locomotion and cognition have been developed that involve the processing of visual stimuli. However, the innate preference for vertical and horizontal stripes in zebrafish is unknown. We tested the preference of adult zebrafish for three achromatic patterns (vertical stripes, horizontal stripes, and squares) at three different size conditions (1, 5, and 10 mm). Each animal was tested once in a rectangular arena, which had a different pattern of the same size condition on the walls of either half of the arena. We show that zebrafish have differential preferences for patterned stimuli at each of the three size conditions. These results suggest that zebrafish have naïve preferences that should be carefully considered when testing zebrafish in paradigms using visual stimuli. © 2017 Rimstad et al.

AB  - Sewage effluents contain pharmaceuticals, personal care products and industrial chemicals, exposing aquatic organisms to complex mixtures. The consequences of exposure to combinations of different classes of drugs in fish are largely unknown. In this study, we exposed adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) males and females for two weeks to low, environmentally relevant concentrations of the endocrine disrupting chemical 17α-etinylestradiol (EE2) and the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram, alone and in combination, and analyzed behaviors of importance for population fitness, scototaxis (light/dark preference), the novel tank test and shoal cohesion. Control water contained 0.4 ng/L EE2 and the measured exposure concentrations were 0.9 ng/L EE2 (nominal 0.1) and 1 ng/L EE2 (nominal 0.5). The measured concentrations of citalopram were 0.1 (nominal 0.1) and 0.4 μg/L (nominal 0.5). Both EE2 exposures increased anxiety in males in the scototaxis test, with significantly longer latency periods before entering and fewer visits to the white zone of the tank. The combined exposures (0.9 ng/L EE2 + 0.1 μg/L citalopram and 1 ng/L EE2 + 0.4 μg/L citalopram) resulted in abolishment of effects of EE2, with shorter latency period and more transitions to white than for fish exposed to EE2 alone. In the novel tank test, the results surprisingly indicated lower anxiety after both EE2 and citalopram exposure. Significantly more transitions to the upper half of the tank observed in males exposed to 0.1 μg/L citalopram alone compared to control males. Males exposed to EE2 (0.9 ng/L) had shorter latency period to the upper half. Combination exposure resulted in a longer latency and fewer transitions to the upper half compared to both control, EE2- and citalopram-exposed males. Males exposed to the combination spent significantly less time in the upper half than males EE2 or citalopram-exposed males. Females exposed to 1 ng/L EE2 had fewer transitions to the upper half than the control group and females exposed to 0.4 μg/L citalopram. In the shoaling test, males exposed to 0.1 μg/L citalopram + 0.9 ng/L EE2 showed more transitions away from peers than males exposed to 0.1 μg/L citalopram alone. In conclusion, low concentrations of EE2, closely above the predicted no effect concentration (NOEC) of 0.1 ng/L, created anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish males. Citalopram showed marginal effects at these low concentrations but in the combination exposure the behavioral effects of EE2 were abolished. This is an initial effort to understand the effects of cocktails of anthropogenic substances contaminating aquatic environments. © 2017

AB  - The aim of this work was to develop a novel methodology to stress test the diagnostic capability of a video tracking system with zebrafish (Danio rerio), against two pre-established disturbances. Eight different treatments were tested varying the presence or absence of a toxicant (NaOCl) and two disturbances: the passing of a shadow (mimicking a predator) and entrapment of the fish. The concentration tested corresponded to a sublethal (1 % 24 h-LC50) and short term exposure (2 h). A total of 56 organisms were tested resulting in 112 diagnoses (before and after the contamination). A statistical model of diagnosis was developed using Self-organizing Map (SOM) and Correspondence Analysis (CA). Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, false positive and false negative values were calculated to evaluate the diagnostic performance. The disturbances did not negatively affect the capability of the model. In the presence of at least one of these variables, the diagnostic performance was similar or even superior to the baseline results without disturbances. Furthermore, the system produced a large number of correct diagnoses, at an ecologically relevant concentration of exposure, in a non-invasive way. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The zebrafish enjoys several advantages over other model organisms. It is small, easy to maintain, prolific, and numerous genetic tools are available for it. For example, forward genetic screens have allowed investigators to identify important genes potentially involved in a variety of functions from embryogenesis to cancer. However, despite its sophisticated behavioral repertoire, behavioral methods have rarely been utilized in forward genetic screens. Here, we employ a two-tiered strategy, a proof of concept study, to explore the feasibility of behavioral screens. We generated mutant lines using transposon-based insertional mutagenesis, allowing us to bias mutant selection with target genes expressed within the brain. Furthermore, we employed an efficient and fast behavioral pre-selection in which we investigated the locomotory response of 5-day post-fertilization old larval fish to hyperosmotic shock. Based on this assay, we selected five lines for our lower throughput secondary adult behavioral screen. The latter screen utilized tests in which computer animated image presentation and video-tracking-based automated quantification of behavior allowed us to compare heterozygous zebrafish with their wild-type siblings on their responses to a variety of stimuli. We found significant mutation induced adult behavioral alterations in 4 out of the 5 lines analyzed, including changes in response to social or fear inducing stimuli, to handling and novelty, or in habituation to novelty. We discuss the pros and cons of behavioral phenotyping and of the use of different forward genetic methods in biomedical research with zebrafish. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) may vary in symptoms and severity. In the milder and more prevalent forms of the disease, behavioral abnormalities may include impaired social behavior, for example, difficulty interpreting social cues. Patients with FASD remain often undiagnosed due to lack of biomarkers, and treatment is unavailable because the mechanisms of the disease are not yet understood. Animal models have been proposed to facilitate addressing these problems. More recently, short exposure of the zebrafish embryo to low concentrations of alcohol was shown to lead to significant and lasting impairment of behavior in response to social stimuli. The impairment may be the result of abnormal social behavior or altered fear/anxiety. The goal of the current study was to investigate the latter. Methods: Here, we employed the alcohol exposure regimen used previously (exposure of 24th hour postfertilization embryos to 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, or 1.00% vol/vol alcohol for 2 hours), allowed the fish to reach adulthood, and measured the behavioral responses of these adults to a novel tank (anxiety-related behaviors) as well as to an animated image of a sympatric predator of zebrafish (fear-related behaviors). Results: We found behavioral responses of embryonic alcohol-exposed adult fish to remain statistically indistinguishable from those of controls, suggesting unaltered anxiety and fear in the embryonic alcohol-treated fish. Conclusions: Given that motor and perceptual function was previously shown to be also unaltered in the adults after embryonic alcohol exposure, our current results suggest that the impaired response of these fish to social stimuli may be the result of abnormal social behavior.

AB  - The zebrafish has been shown to be a powerful experimental test subject for research in different areas, predominantly in neuroscience and behavior. Many classical tests used for rodents have already been adapted into or inspired new tests for fish. Nonetheless, the elevated plus maze, one of the most used experimental tests for rodents, still didn’t have an equivalent for fish. In this study, we suggest a plus maze with ramp tank—in which the arms with ramps are equivalent to the opened arms of the elevated plus maze, and the flat arms are equivalent to the closed arms of the test for rodents. Since this was a pilot study, we tested different water column heights and different test lengths and the effects of alcohol and clonazepam. Our results revealed that, regardless of the height of the water column and the length of the trial, the animals preferred the flat arms in comparison to the arms with ramps, either for spending more time in or entering into those arms more times. Both drugs tested showed anxiolytic effect. Based on our results and prior studies showing anxiety-related dive responses in zebrafish, we propose that the plus maze with ramps is a valid tool for the study of anxiety, allowing the comparison of its data with data obtained from tests with rodents. © 2016 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Cyclooxygenases (COX)-1 and -2 are isoenzymes that catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins (PGs). COX-2 and PGs are rapidly increased following seizures and are known to play important roles in the neuroinflammatory process. COX-2 isoform has been predominantly explored as the most suitable target for pharmacological intervention in epilepsy studies, while COX-1 remains poorly investigated. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of selective COX-1 inhibitor or selective COX-2 inhibitor on seizure suppression in the zebrafish pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-seizure model. Zebrafish larvae were incubated in 5 μM of SC-236 for 24 h or 2.8 μM of SC-560 for 30 min, followed by exposure to 15 mM PTZ for 60 min. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis was carried out to investigate transcription levels of cox1 (ptgs1), as well as to determine cfos levels, used as a marker for neuronal activity. Effects of selective COX-2 or COX-1 inhibitors on locomotor activity response (velocity and distance moved) during PTZ exposure were evaluated using the Danio Vision video-tracking system. Our results showed an inducible expression of the cox1 gene after 60 min of PTZ exposure. Cox1 mRNA levels were upregulated compared with the control group. We found that COX-2 inhibition treatment had no effect on zebrafish PTZ-induced seizures. On the other hand, COX-1 inhibition significantly attenuated PTZ-induced increase of locomotor activity and reduced the c-fos mRNA expression. These findings suggest that COX-1 inhibition rather than COX-2 has positive effects on seizure suppression in the zebrafish PTZ-seizure model. © 2016 Barbalho, Carvalho, Lopes-Cendes and Maurer-Morelli.

AB  - Little is known about the pharmacological effects of amphetamine derivatives. In the present study, the effect on social preference and anxiety-like behavior of 2,5-dimetoxy-4-bromo-amphetamine hydrobromide (DOB) and para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA), in comparison with 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) was investigated in zebrafish, an emerging model to study emotional behavior in an inexpensive and quick manner. DOB (0.05–2 mg/kg), PMA (0.0005–2 mg/kg) or MDMA (0.25–20 mg/kg), given i.m. to adult zebrafish, progressively increased the time spent in the proximity of nacre fish picture in a social preference test. However, high doses were ineffective. Similarly, in the novel tank diving and light-dark tests the compounds elicited a progressive anxiolytic effect in terms of time spent in the upper half of the tank and in the light compartment, respectively. All the above effects were interpolated by symmetrical parabolas. The 5-HT2A/C antagonist ritanserin (0.025–2.5 mg/kg) in association with the maximal effective dose of MDMA, DOB and PMA blocked both the social and anxiolytic effect. Taken together these findings demonstrate for the first time the prosocial and anxiolytic properties of DOB and PMA and focus on the mechanisms of their action through the serotonergic-like system suggesting a potential clinical application. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An effective biological early warning system for the detection of water contamination should employ undemanding species that rapidly react to the presence of contaminants in their environment. The demonstrated reaction should be comprehensible and unambiguously evidential of the contamination event. This study utilized 96 h post fertilization zebrafish larvae and tested their behavioral response to acute exposure to low concentrations of cadmium chloride (CdCl2) (5.0, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625 mg/L) and permethrin (0.05, 0.029, 0.017, 0.01 μg/L). We hypothesize that the number of larvae that show advanced trajectories in a group corresponds with water contamination, as the latter triggers avoidance behavior in the organisms. The proportion of advanced trajectories in the control and treated groups during the first minute of darkness was designated as a segregation parameter. It was parametrized and a threshold value was set using one CdCl2 trial and then applied to the remaining CdCl2 and permethrin replicates. For all cases, the method allowed distinguishing between the control and treated groups within two cycles of light: dark. The calculated parameter was statistically significantly different between the treated and control groups, except for the lowest CdCl2 concentration (0.625 mg/L) in one replicate. This proof-of-concept study shows the potential of the proposed methodology for utilization as part of a multispecies biomonitoring system. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor β2 subunit gene (GABRB2) have been associated with schizophrenia and quantitatively correlated with mRNA expression in the postmortem brain tissue of patients with schizophrenia. l-Methionine (MET) administration has been reported to cause a recrudescence of psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, and similar symptoms have been generated in MET-induced mice. In this study, a zebrafish animal model was used to evaluate the relationship between the gabrb2 mRNA expression and its promoter DNA methylation in developmental and MET-induced schizophrenia-like zebrafish. The results indicated developmental increases in global DNA methylation and decreases in gabrb2 promoter methylation in zebrafish. A significant increase in gabrb2 mRNA levels was observed after GABA was synthesized. Additionally, the MET-triggered schizophrenia-like symptoms in adult zebrafish, involving social withdrawal and cognitive dysfunction analyzed with social interaction and T-maze behavioral tests, were accompanied by significantly increased DNA methylation levels in the global genome and the gabrb2 promoter. Furthermore, the significant correlation between gabrb2 mRNA expression and gabrb2 promoter methylation observed in the developmental stages became non-significant in MET-triggered adult zebrafish. These findings demonstrate that gabrb2 mRNA expression is associated with DNA methylation varies by developmental stage and show that these epigenetic association mechanisms are disrupted in MET-triggered adult zebrafish with schizophrenia-like symptoms. In conclusion, these results provide plausible epigenetic evidence of the GABAA receptor β2 subunit involvement in the schizophrenia-like behaviors and demonstrate the potential use of zebrafish models in neuropsychiatric research. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society

AB  - Prenatal exposure to sodium valproate (VPA), a widely used anti-epileptic drug, is related to a series of dysfunctions, such as deficits in language and communication. Clinical and animal studies have indicated that the effects of VPA are related to the concentration and to the exposure window, while the neurobehavioral effects of VPA have received limited research attention. In the current study, to analyze the neurobehavioral effects of VPA, zebrafish at 24 h post-fertilization (hpf) were treated with early chronic exposure to 20 μM VPA for 7 h per day for 6 days or with early acute exposure to 100 μM VPA for 7 h. A battery of behavioral screenings was conducted at 1 month of age to investigate social preference, locomotor activity, anxiety, and behavioral response to light change. A social preference deficit was only observed in animals with chronic VPA exposure. Acute VPA exposure induced a change in the locomotor activity, while chronic VPA exposure did not affect locomotor activity. Neither exposure procedure influenced anxiety or the behavioral response to light change. These results suggested that VPA has the potential to affect some behaviors in zebrafish, such as social behavior and the locomotor activity, and that the effects were closely related to the concentration and the exposure window. Additionally, social preference seemed to be independent from other simple behaviors. © 2016 Liu, Zhang, Lin, Xia, Guo and Li.

AB  - Rationale: Several model organisms have been employed to study the impacts of stress on biological systems. Different models of unpredictable chronic stress (UCS) have been established in rodents; however, these protocols are expensive, long-lasting, and require a large physical structure. Our group has recently reported an UCS protocol in zebrafish with several advantages compared to rodent models. We observed that UCS induced behavioral, biochemical, and molecular changes similar to those observed in depressed patients, supporting the translational relevance of the protocol. Objectives: Considering that a pharmacological assessment is lacking in this zebrafish model, our aim was to evaluate the effects of anxiolytic (bromazepam) and antidepressant drugs (fluoxetine and nortriptyline) on behavioral (novel tank test), biochemical (whole-body cortisol), and molecular parameters (cox-2, tnf-α, il-6, and il-10 gene expression) in zebrafish subjected to UCS. Results: We replicated previous data showing that UCS induces behavioral and neuroendocrine alterations in zebrafish, and we show for the first time that anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs are able to prevent such effects. Furthermore, we extended the molecular characterization of the model, revealing that UCS increases expression of the pro-inflammatory markers cox-2 and il-6, which was also prevented by the drugs tested. Conclusions: This study reinforces the use of zebrafish as a model organism to study the behavioral and physiological effects of stress. The UCS protocol may also serve as a screening tool for evaluating new drugs that can be used to treat psychiatric disorders with stress-related etiologies. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Background Behavioural neuroscience relies on software driven methods for behavioural assessment, but the field lacks cost-effective, robust, open source software for behavioural analysis. New Method Here we propose a novel method which we called as ZebraTrack. It includes cost-effective imaging setup for distraction-free behavioural acquisition, automated tracking using open-source ImageJ software and workflow for extraction of behavioural endpoints. Our ImageJ algorithm is capable of providing control to users at key steps while maintaining automation in tracking without the need for the installation of external plugins. Results We have validated this method by testing novelty induced anxiety behaviour in adult zebrafish. Our results, in agreement with established findings, showed that during state-anxiety, zebrafish showed reduced distance travelled, increased thigmotaxis and freezing events. Furthermore, we proposed a method to represent both spatial and temporal distribution of choice-based behaviour which is currently not possible to represent using simple videograms. Comparison with existing method(s) ZebraTrack method is simple and economical, yet robust enough to give results comparable with those obtained from costly proprietary software like Ethovision XT. Conclusion We have developed and validated a novel cost-effective method for behavioural analysis of adult zebrafish using open-source ImageJ software. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The influence of the microbiota on behavior and stress responses is poorly understood. Zebrafish larvae have unique characteristics that are advantageous for neuroimmune research, however, they are currently underutilized for such studies. Here, we used germ-free zebrafish to determine the effects of the microbiota on behavior and stress testing. The absence of a microbiota dramatically altered locomotor and anxiety-related behavior. Additionally, characteristic responses to an acute stressor were also obliterated in larvae lacking exposure to microbes. Lastly, treatment with the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum was sufficient to attenuate anxiety-related behavior in conventionally-raised zebrafish larvae. These results underscore the importance of the microbiota in communicating to the CNS via the microbiome-gut-brain axis and set a foundation for using zebrafish larvae for neuroimmune research. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a promising model organism for neurophenomics - a new field of neuroscience linking neural phenotypes to various genetic and environmental factors. However, the effects of prior experimental manipulations on zebrafish performance in different behavioral paradigms remain unclear. Here, we examine the influence of selected stressful procedures and test batteries on adult zebrafish anxiety-like behaviors in two commonly used models - the novel tank (NTT) and the light-dark box (LDB) tests. While no overt behavioral differences between outbred short-fin wild-type (WT) and mutant 'pink' glowfish were seen in both tests under baseline (control) conditions, an acute severe stressor (a 30-min car transportation) detected significantly lower mutant fish anxiety-like behavior in these tests. In contrast, WT zebrafish showed no overt NTT or LDB responses following a mild stressor (5-min 40-Wt light) exposure, also showing no differences in batteries of NTT and LDB run immediately one after another, or with a 1-day interval. Collectively, these findings suggest that zebrafish may be relatively less sensitive (e.g., than other popular species, such as rodents) to the test battery effect, and show that stronger stressors may be needed (to complement low-to-moderate stress aquatic screens) to better reveal phenotypical variance in zebrafish assays. Strengthening the value of zebrafish models in neurophenotyping research, this study indicates the potential of using more test batteries and a wider spectrum of pre-test stressors in zebrafish behavioral assays. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the development of new tools such as biological early warning systems, it becomes extremely important to test their reliability and detection capability. This work aimed at testing the sturdiness of a video tracking system by determining whether the detection capability does not deteriorate over time, after successive exposures of the zebrafish to three different toxicants, namely sodium hypochlorite, bisphenol A, and ethanol. Zebrafish were exposed to the three tested compounds separately (one fish, one toxicant) once a day, for 1 h and 30 m over 9 days, to 9 % of the 96 h LC50 of the respective toxicant. The behavior analysis was based on nine movement descriptor parameters of the fish, namely: angular velocity; linear velocity; spatial dispersion; linear acceleration; and angular acceleration. A statistical method was developed using self-organizing map (SOM), correspondence analysis, and linear and orthogonal multiple regression models. The results indicated that the system was able to successfully detect the three toxicants. With ethanol, the detection capability was maintained, but in the case of the sodium hypochlorite and bisphenol A, a deterioration of the detection capability occurred over the 9 days. This effect may be due to the induction of detoxification mechanisms and physiological acclimation, or due to the accumulation of adverse effects caused by the repeated exposure to the toxicants. Future works, especially those focusing on the application of similar early warning systems in real-world scenarios, should regularly exchange the sentinel organisms, to avoid degradation of the detection capability, as verified with two of the three tested compounds. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - A behavioral syndrome exists when specific behaviors interact under different contexts. Zebrafish have been test subjects in recent studies and it is important to standardize protocols to ensure proper analyses and interpretations. In our previous studies, we have measured boldness by monitoring a series of behaviors (time near surface, latency in transitions, number of transitions, and darts) in a 1.5 L trapezoidal tank. Likewise, we quantified aggression by observing bites, lateral displays, darts, and time near an inclined mirror in a rectangular 19 L tank. By dividing a 76 L tank into thirds, we also examined shoaling preferences. The shoaling assay is a highly customizable assay and can be tailored for specific hypotheses. However, protocols for this assay also must be standardized, yet flexible enough for customization. In previous studies, end chambers were either empty, contained 5 or 10 zebrafish, or 5 pearl danios (D. albolineatus). In the following manuscript, we present a detailed protocol and representative data that accompany successful applications of the protocol, which will allow for replication of behavioral syndrome experiments. © 2016 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

AB  - Background. The zebrafish has become a popular animal model for behavioral pharmacology. One of the greatest advantages of the zebrafish is its amenability for high throughput screens to identify anxiety altering compounds. The novel tank diving test is arguably one of the most commonly utilized behavioral tests for quantifying anxiety-like behavioral responses in zebrafish. However, a number of context-dependent anxiety-like behavioral responses have recently been reported in the literature for this task, and the validity of using a single measure, the diving response, has been questioned. Objective. In this review, we discuss multiple behavioral parameters that can be used to evaluate performance in the novel tank diving test which can serve as indicators of anxiety. In addition, we also discuss the difficulties associated with interpretation of behavioral measures of anxiety, a question complicated by context-dependent behavioral responses induced by handling the fish with a net, a known stressor. Conclusion. The zebrafish is a relative newcomer in the psychopharmacological analysis of anxiety, but the increasing number of efficient behavioural tests and the translational relevance of this species make the zebrafish a potentially useful laboratory species for screening of anxiolytic compounds. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Background: The zebrafish has been a favorite of developmental biologists and geneticists for decades, however, recently, it has gained popularity among behavior researchers too. The reason for the popularity of this species is that while it is a simple vertebrate, it possesses numerous features that make it translationally relevant. Objective: Social interaction is an essential component of human as well as zebrafish behavior; yet, the biological mechanisms underlying social behavior and its dysfunction remain poorly understood in both species. This review focuses on pharmacological manipulation of social behavior in zebrafish, studies where the ultimate goal is to understand the psychopharmacology of human behavior. Methods: We focused specifically on quantification of social interaction, specifically shoaling, in zebrafish, and compared it to rodent literature where appropriate. If no social studies exist for specific classes of compounds in zebrafish or if other behaviors may help with interpretation of social responses, we also highlighted non-social behaviors (locomotion, anxiety, etc). Results: We discussed findings on the effect of exposure of zebrafish to alcohol, psychostimulants, depressants and other drugs of abuse. Comparison of studies that have quantified and manipulated zebrafish social behavior of either single zebrafish or groups of zebrafish highlight both growth and gaps in this rapidly evolving field. Conclusion: Although new in psychopharmacology research, the zebrafish will be an important tool with which analysis and modeling of human social behavior and disorders involving social abnormalities including Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, Autism spectrum disorders, and Schizophrenia may be facilitated. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) antagonist, is a convulsant drug, known to induce anxiety and seizures in zebrafish. Changes in the mobility of zebrafish under light-dark transitions reflect anxiety level, serving as a useful behavioral readout. The effects of PTZ treatment have yet to be assayed in this manner. Zebrafish larvae (AB strain) at both 5 dpf (days post-fertilization) and 7 dpf were treated with different concentrations of PTZ. General locomotor activity and thigmotaxis were analyzed under continuous illumination (normal conditions) or alternating light-dark cycles (stressful conditions). Zebrafish larvae of 5 dpf and 7 dpf exhibited different sensitivities to PTZ. Anxiety level, measured in terms of response to illumination transitions under the influence of PTZ, demonstrated contrasting tendencies. Dark-light transitions dramatically increased the locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae receiving 8 mM PTZ which was indicative of anxiety. This study suggests that PTZ increases the susceptibility by activating the neuron, which perhaps makes light change easier to influence the anxiety level of larvae. We provide useful evidence for putative anti-anxiety drug screening. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Jundiá (Rhamdia quelen) is a suitable species for aquaculture in regions of temperate or subtropical climate. This species has received great attention regarding several aspects of physiology as well as an organism to study the impact of environmental contaminations. However, experiments using validated and objective tests to evaluate the jundiá behavior are scarce. The effects of acute stress have been studied in other fish species, such as zebrafish (Danio rerio), however, the effects in jundiá are lacking. Thus, we evaluated the effects of acute stress (net chasing) on anxiety-like and social behavior in jundiá. For these purpose, all behavioral analyses were carried out using automated tracking software. We showed that the acute stress protocol increased cortisol levels and induced anxiogenic-like behavior in the novel tank test, and decreased social behavior in jundiá. The antidepressant fluoxetine was able to prevent the effects of acute stress on social behavior. Here we show a behavioral evaluation of Rhamdia quelen using consolidated tests and computerized analysis, which allows more measurable, reliable and comparable results. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The aquatic environment provides a sink for the environmental pollutants that have potential to induce oxidative stress by altering neurobehavioral response of aquatic animals. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is known to induce oxidative stress in the brain. Withania somnifera has been used traditionally for its neuroprotective effect in experimental models of neurological disorders. The present study is aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of Withania somnifera leaf extract (WSLE) following exposure to waterborne B[a]P. Wild-type zebrafish (Danio rerio) were designated as naive, control (dimethyl sulfoxide), WSLE, B[a]P, and B[a]P + WSLE groups. Behavioral studies showed reversal in scototaxis (anxiety-like) behavior in B[a]P group and was restored by WSLE cosupplementation in B[a]P + WSLE group. B[a]P-induced altered antioxidant status was ameliorated by WSLE in the B[a]P + WSLE group. Previous studies showed that the periventricular gray zone (PGZ) of the optic tectum in zebrafish brain regulates scototaxis (anxiety-like) behavior. Our histopathological observation showed a significant increase in the pyknotic neuronal counts in PGZ of the B[a]P group and was ameliorated by WSLE cosupplementation. The study showed that the reversal in scototaxis behavior following exposure to waterborne B[a]P might be associated with neuromorphological alterations in PGZ, whereas a pioneer ethnopharmacological approach of WSLE cosupplementation showed its neuroprotective role to restore normal scototaxis of zebrafish. Future research directing toward understanding the role of visual circuit involved with impaired scototaxis behavior in zebrafish might provide new pathological outcomes following exposure to B[a]P. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.

AB  - Rationale: The dopaminergic system has been proposed to mediate alcohol-induced locomotor activity, yet the mechanisms underlying this behavioral response remain poorly understood. Objectives: This study was conducted to investigate the role of dopamine D2-like receptors in mediating alcohol-induced behavioral responses. Methods: In experiment 1, we examined the effects of high concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10 μM) of haloperidol on motor responses. In experiment 2, we examined the effects of low concentrations (0, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5 μM) of haloperidol on anxiety-like behavioral responses using the novel tank test. In experiment 3, we examined the effect of pre-treating zebrafish with different concentrations of haloperidol (0, 0.625, 2.5 μM) and subsequently exposing them to 0 or 1 % alcohol. Results: In experiment 1, haloperidol induced an inverted U-shaped concentration-dependent increase in locomotor activity. In experiment 2, haloperidol (2.5 μM) reduced the absolute turn angle and freezing behavior in a new environment. In experiment 3, acute alcohol exposure significantly increased locomotor activity and decreased anxiety-like behavioral responses. Pre-treating zebrafish with the lower dose of haloperidol (0.625 μM) abolished the alcohol-induced locomotor activity, without altering anxiety-like behavioral responses. However, pre-treating with the higher dose of haloperidol (2.5 μM) abolished both alcohol-induced increase of locomotor activity and reduction of anxiety-like behavioral responses. Conclusion: The results suggest alcohol-induced locomotor hyperactivity in zebrafish is mediated via activation of dopamine D2-like receptors, whereas anxiety-like behavioral responses may only be altered by a high haloperidol concentration, at which dose the drug may affect receptors other than D2-R. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The presence of synthetic glucocorticoids within the aquatic environment has been highlighted as a potential environmental concern as they may mimic the role of endogenous glucocorticoids during vertebrate ontogeny. Prednisolone is a commonly prescribed synthetic glucocorticoid which has been repeatedly detected in the environment. This study investigated the impact of environmentally relevant concentrations of prednisolone (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/L) during zebrafish embryogenesis using physiological and behavioral end points which are known to be mediated by endogenous glucocorticoids. The frequency of spontaneous muscle contractions (24 hpf) was significantly reduced by prednisolone and 0.1 μg/L increased the distance embryos swam in response to a mechanosensory stimulus (48 hpf). The percentage of embryos hatched significantly increased following prednisolone treatment (1 and 10 μg/L), while growth and mortality were unaffected. The onset of heart contraction was differentially affected by prednisolone while heart rate and oxygen consumption both increased significantly throughout embryogenesis. No substantial effect on the axial musculature was observed. Morphological changes to the lower jaw were detected at 96 hpf in response to 1 μg/L of prednisolone. Several parameters of swim behavior were also significantly affected. Environmentally relevant concentrations of prednisolone therefore alter early zebrafish ontogeny and significantly affect embryo behavior. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The zebrafish may be uniquely well suited for studying alcohol's mechanisms of action in vivo, since alcohol can be administered via immersion in a non-invasive manner. Despite the robust behavioural effects of alcohol administration in mammals, studies reporting the locomotor stimulant and anxiolytic effects of alcohol in zebrafish have been inconsistent. In the current study, we examined whether differences in the type of water used for alcohol exposure and behavioural testing contribute to these inconsistencies. To answer this question, we exposed zebrafish to either home water from their housing tanks or novel water from an isolated reservoir (i.e. water lacking zebrafish chemosensory and olfactory cues) with 0% or 1% v/v alcohol for 30 min, a 2 × 2 between subject experimental designs. Behavioural responses were quantified throughout the 30-minute exposure session via a video tracking system. Although control zebrafish exposed to home water and novel water were virtually indistinguishable in their behavioural responses, alcohol's effect on locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavioural responses were dependent on the type of water used for testing. Alcohol exposure in home tank water produced a mild anxiolytic and locomotor stimulant effect, whereas alcohol exposure in novel water produced an anxiogenic effect without altering locomotor activity. These results represent a dissociation between alcohol's effects on locomotor and anxiety related responses, and also illustrate how environmental factors, in this case familiarity with the water, may interact with such effects. In light of these findings, we urge researchers to explicitly state the type of water used. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Embryonic exposure to ethanol is known to affect neurochemical systems in rodents and increase alcohol drinking and related behaviors in humans and rodents. With zebrafish emerging as a powerful tool for uncovering neural mechanisms of numerous diseases and exhibiting similarities to rodents, the present report building on our rat studies examined in zebrafish the effects of embryonic ethanol exposure on hypothalamic neurogenesis, expression of orexigenic neuropeptides, and voluntary ethanol consumption and locomotor behaviors in larval and adult zebrafish, and also effects of central neuropeptide injections on these behaviors affected by ethanol. At 24 h post-fertilization, zebrafish embryos were exposed for 2 h to ethanol, at low concentrations of 0.25% and 0.5%, in the tank water. Embryonic ethanol compared to control dose-dependently increased hypothalamic neurogenesis and the proliferation and expression of the orexigenic peptides, galanin (GAL) and orexin (OX), in the anterior hypothalamus. These changes in hypothalamic peptide neurons were accompanied by an increase in voluntary consumption of 10% ethanol-gelatin and in novelty-induced locomotor and exploratory behavior in adult zebrafish and locomotor activity in larvae. After intracerebroventricular injection, these peptides compared to vehicle had specific effects on these behaviors altered by ethanol, with GAL stimulating consumption of 10% ethanol-gelatin more than plain gelatin food and OX stimulating novelty-induced locomotor behavior while increasing intake of food and ethanol equally. These results, similar to those obtained in rats, suggest that the ethanol-induced increase in genesis and expression of these hypothalamic peptide neurons contribute to the behavioral changes induced by embryonic exposure to ethanol. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rationale: The function of the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1-R) is poorly understood in zebrafish, and numerous inconsistent effects have been reported on it in the literature. Objective: The objective of the present study is to determine whether differences in the reported effects of CB1-R antagonism on anxiety-like behavioural responses, dopaminergic and serotonergic responses are due to concentration, context-dependent and/or population (genotype-related) effects. Method: Two genetically distinct populations of zebrafish (AB and short fin (SF)) were treated with different concentrations of AM251 (0, 0.1, 1mg/L), and behavioural responses were quantified under two different contexts: one, following habituation and two, subsequently in a novel environment. The levels of dopamine, serotonin and their metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyindole acetic acid (DOPAC) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were quantified from whole-brain tissue. Results: We demonstrate that a 60-min exposure to AM251 (0, 0.1, 1mg/L) does not alter behavioural performance following habituation in either populations. However, when subsequently transferred to a novel environment, zebrafish that were pre-treated with the highest dose of AM251 (1mg/L) exhibited increased anxiety-like behavioural responses including elevated absolute turn angle, freezing and bottom dwelling. We found that exposure to the highest dose of AM251 (1mg/L) for 60min increased serotonin in fish of both populations tested. In contrast, exposure to 0.1mg/L AM251 decreased, whereas to 1mg/L AM251 increased dopamine, DOPAC and 5-HIAA in fish of both populations. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a genotype-independent effect of AM251 but imply that the inconsistent findings obtained after pharmacological blockade of CB1-Rs in zebrafish may be due to a combination of concentration- and environmental context-dependent effects. © 2016 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is not only a widely used species in the Fish Embryo Toxicity (FET) test but also an emerging model in behavioural ecotoxicology. By using automatic behaviour tracking technology, locomotion of developing zebrafish (ZF) larvae can be accurately recorded and potentially used in an ecotoxicological context to detect toxicant-induced behavioural alterations. In this study, we explored if and how quantitative locomotion data can be used for sub-lethal toxicity testing within the FET framework. We exposed ZF embryos to silver ions and nanoparticles, which previously have been reported to cause neurodevelopmental toxicity and behavioural retardation in early-life stages of ZF. Exposure to a broad range of silver (Ag+ and AgNPs) concentrations was conducted, and developmental toxicity was assessed using FET criteria. For behavioural toxicity assessment, locomotion of exposed ZF eleutheroembryos (120 hpf) was quantified according to a customised behavioural assay in an automatic video tracking system. A set of repeated episodes of dark/light stimulation were used to artificially stress ZF and evoke photo-motor responses, which were consequently utilized for locomotion profiling. Our locomotion-based behaviour profiling approach consisted of (1) dose-response ranking for multiple and single locomotion variables; (2) quantitative assessment of locomotion structure; and (3) analysis of ZF responsiveness to darkness stimulation. We documented that both silver forms caused adverse effects on development and inhibited hatchability and, most importantly, altered locomotion. High Ag+ and AgNPs exposures significantly suppressed locomotion and a clear shift in locomotion towards inactivity was reported. Additionally, we noted that low, environmentally relevant Ag+ concentrations may cause subordinate locomotive changes (hyperactivity) in developing fish. Overall, it was concluded that our locomotion-based behaviour-testing scheme can be used jointly with FET and can provide endpoints for sub-lethal toxicity. When combined with multivariate data analysis, this approach facilitated new insights for handling and analysis of data generated by automatized behavioural tracking systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (Vmat2) is widely distributed in the central nervous system, and responsible for uptaking transmitters into the vesicles. However, whether Vmat2-deficiency is related to the anxiety is rarely investigated, especially in zebrafish. Here, we reported Vmat2 heterzygous mutant zebrafish displayed anxiety-like behavior. The mutants spent less time in the top area and took longer latency to the top in the novel tank test. Consistently, they showed dark avoidance in the light/dark box test, with longer duration in the light zone and increased number of crossing between the two zones. Monoamine concentration analysis showed that the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters including dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxy tryptamine (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE), as well as their metabolites were decreased in VMAT mutants. Taken together, these findings suggest that Vmat2 heterzygous mutant zebrafish may serve as a new model of anxiety, which may be related with the low level of DA, 5-HT and NE. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The increase in brain levels of chelatable zinc (Zn) in dysfunctions involving oxygen deprivation has stimulated the treatment with Zn chelators, such as diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC). However, DEDTC is a redox-active compound and it should be better evaluated during hypoxia. We use the hypoxia model in zebrafish to evaluate DEDTC effects. The exploratory behavior, chelatable Zn content, activities of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, reactive species levels (nitric oxide, superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical scavenger capacity) and cellular antioxidants (sulfhydryl, superoxide dismutase) of zebrafish brain were assessed after recovery, with or without 0.2 mM DEDTC. The increased brain levels of chelatable Zn induced by hypoxia were mitigated by DEDTC. However, the novel tank task indicated that DEDTC did further enhance the exploratory deficit caused by hypoxia. Furthermore, these behavioral impairments caused by DEDTC were more associated with a negative action on mitochondrial activity and brain oxidative balance. Thus, due to apparent pro-oxidant action of DEDTC, our data do not support its use for neuroprotection in neuropathologies involving oxygen deprivation.

AB  - Variation among individuals may arise for several reasons, and may have diverse underlying mechanisms. Individual differences have been studied in a variety of species, but recently a new model organism has emerged in this field that offers both sophistication in phenotypical characterization and powerful mechanistic analysis. Recently, zebrafish, one of the favorites of geneticists, have been shown to exhibit consistent individual differences in baseline locomotor activity. In the current study, we further explore this finding and examine whether individual differences in locomotor activity correlate with anxiety-like behavioral measures and with levels of dopamine, serotonin and the metabolites of these neurotransmitters. In addition, we examine whether individual differences in locomotor activity are also associated with reactivity to the locomotor stimulant effects of and neurochemical responses to acute ethanol exposure (30. min long, 1% v/v ethanol bath application). Principal component analyses revealed a strong association among anxiety-like responses, locomotor activity, serotonin and dopamine levels. Furthermore, ethanol exposure was found to abolish the locomotion-dependent anxiety-like behavioral and serotonergic responses suggesting that this drug also engages a common underlying pathway. Overall, our results provide support for an important role of the serotonergic system in mediating individual differences in anxiety-like responses and locomotor activity in zebrafish and for a minor modulatory role of the dopaminergic system. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Taurine (TAU) is an amino sulfonic acid with several functions in central nervous system. Mounting evidence suggests that it acts in osmoregulation, neuromodulation and also as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. However, the effects of TAU on behavioral functions, especially on anxiety-related parameters, are limited. The adult zebrafish is a suitable model organism to examine anxiety-like behaviors since it presents neurotransmitter systems and behavioral functions evolutionary conserved. Anxiety in zebrafish can be measured by different tasks, analyzing the habituation to novelty, as well as the response to brightly lit environments. The aim of this study was to investigate whether acute TAU treatment alters anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish using the novel tank and the light-dark tests. Fish were individually treated with TAU (42, 150, and 400. mg/L) for 1. h and the behaviors were further analyzed for 6. min in the novel tank or in the light-dark test. Control fish were handled in a similar manner, but kept only in home tank water. Although TAU did not alter locomotor and vertical activities, all concentrations significantly increased shuttling and time spent in lit compartment. Moreover, TAU 150 group showed a significant decrease in the number of risk assessment episodes. Overall, these data suggest that TAU exerts an anxiolytic-like effect in zebrafish and the comparative analysis of behavior using different tasks is an interesting strategy for neuropsychiatric studies related to anxiety in this species. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Early-life stress can cause long-term effects in the adulthood such as alterations in behaviour, brain functions and reproduction. DNA methylation is a mechanism of epigenetic change caused by early-life stress. Dexamethasone (DEX) was administered to zebrafish larvae to study its effect on reproductive dysfunction. The level of GnRH2, GnRH3, Kiss1 and Kiss2 mRNAs were measured between different doses of DEX treatment groups in adult zebrafish. Kiss1 and GnRH2 expression were increased in the 200 mg/L DEX treated while Kiss2 and GnRH3 mRNA levels were up-regulated in the 2 mg/L DEX-treated zebrafish. The up-regulation may be related to programming effect of DEX in the zebrafish larvae, causing overcompensation mechanism to increase the mRNA levels. Furthermore, DEX treatment caused negative impact on the development and maturation of the testes, in particular spermatogenesis. Therefore, immature gonadal development may cause positive feedback by increasing GnRH and Kiss. This indicates that DEX can alter the regulation of GnRH2, GnRH3, Kiss1 and Kiss2 in adult zebrafish, which affects maturation of gonads. Computer analysis of 1.5 kb region upstream of the 5' UTR of Kiss1, Kiss2, GnRH2 and GnRH3 promoter showed that there are putative binding sites of glucocorticoid response element and transcription factors involved in stress response. GnRH3 promoter analysed from pre-optic area, ventral telencephalon and ventral olfactory bulb showed higher methylation at CpG residues located on -1410, -1377 and -1355 between control and 2 mg/L DEX-treated groups. Hence, early-life DEX treatment can alter methylation of GnRH3 gene promoter, which subsequently affects gene regulation and reproductive functions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In zebrafish developmentally exposed to ambient ethanol (20mM-50mM) 1-9 days post fertilization (dpf), the cortisol response to stress has been shown to be significantly attenuated in larvae, juveniles and 6 month old adults. These data are somewhat at variance with similar studies in mammals, which often show heightened stress responses. To test whether these cortisol data correlate with behavioural changes in treated animals, anxiety-like behaviour of zebrafish larvae (9dpf and 10dpf) and juveniles (23dpf) was tested in locomotor assays designed to this end. In open field tests treated animals were more exploratory, spending significantly less time at the periphery of the arena. Behavioural effects of developmental exposure to ethanol were sustained in 6-month-old adults, as judged by assessment of thigmotaxis, novel tank diving and scototaxis. Like larvae and juveniles, developmentally treated adults were generally more exploratory, and spent less time at the periphery of the arena in thigmotaxis tests, less time at the bottom of the tank in the novel tank diving tests, and less time in the dark area in scototaxis tests. The conclusion that ethanol-exposed animals showed less anxiety-like behaviour was validated by comparison with the effects of diazepam treatment, which in thigmotaxis and novel tank diving tests had similar effects to ethanol pretreatment. There is thus a possible link between the hypophysealpituitary-interrenal axis and the behavioural actions of developmental ethanol exposure. The mechanisms require further elucidation. © 2016 Baiamonte et al.

AB  - Methamphetamine (METH), a substance with a high potential for abuse and addiction, is a serious worldwide public health problem. METH addicts often show extreme paranoia, anxiety, and depression. Thus, there is no effective medication for the treatment of METH-induced abnormalities. In the present study, we investigated the effects of l-Scoulerine (l-SLR), a tetrahydroprotoberberine (THPBS) alkaloid, on METH-induced anxiety-like behaviour in zebrafish and METH-induced addictive behavior in mice. In the novel tank test, acute administration of METH (2. mg/L) induced a significant decrease in the number of total vertical transitions and time spent in the upper zone. Moreover, METH produced significant avoidance behaviour showing increased swimming time in the central area and high speed movement in the mirror area in the mirror stimulation test; these anxiety-like changes were attenuated by l-SLR. Chronic administration of METH (2. mg/kg) produced a steady increase in locomotor activity and conditioned place preference in mice. l-SLR (5. mg/kg) failed to reduce acute METH-induced hyperlocomotion, but attenuated chronic METH-induced behavioural sensitization and significantly blocked the expression of conditioned place preference induced by METH in mice. The present study suggests that l-SLR may be a promising agent for the treatment of addiction and anxiety induced by METH. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Alcoholism is one of the most prevalent diseases in society and causes significant health and social problems. Alcohol consumption by pregnant women is reported to cause adverse effects on the physical and psychological growth of the fetus. However, the direct effect of chronic alcohol consumption on reproductive fitness has not been tested. In recent years, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a versatile model system to study the effects of alcohol on behavior and embryonic development. We utilized the zebrafish model system to address the effect of chronic alcohol exposure (0.5% alcohol in the holding tank for 9 weeks) on reproductive capacity. We found a dramatic decrease in fecundity, measured by counting the number of eggs laid, when at least one of the parents is subject to chronic alcohol exposure. Interestingly, a 9-week alcohol withdrawal program completely restored the reproductive capacity of the treated subjects. In agreement with observations on fecundity, the chronic alcohol exposure leads to increased anxiety, as measured by the novel-tank diving assay. Conversely, the withdrawal program diminished heightened anxiety in alcohol-exposed subjects. Our results highlight the adverse effects of chronic alcohol exposure on the reproductive capacity of both males and females, and underscore the utility of the zebrafish model system to understand the biology of chronic alcoholism. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Stress is often considered an important factor in the development of alcohol addiction. In rodents, various types of stressors have been shown to potentiate the effects of alcohol on behavioral responses, and to increase consumption of this substance. However, few have investigated the interaction between stress and alcohol in zebrafish. In the current study we present a repeated handling stress paradigm we developed for zebrafish, and examine whether stress alters alcohol induced behavioral and neurochemical responses. Our results show that repeated handling of zebrafish conducted for 2 consecutive days is sufficient to increase anxiety-like behavioral responses quantified 24 h post-stressor. Repeatedly handled zebrafish also exhibited a reduction in the levels of serotonin's metabolite, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (quantified by high precision liquid chromatography) compared to unhandled controls. A 60-min acute exposure to 1% ethanol was found to significantly increase locomotor activity and decrease anxiety-like behavioral responses in stressed zebrafish but not in controls. Furthermore, unhandled control zebrafish exhibited a significant increase in whole-brain dopamine levels following exposure to ethanol but the increase was not observed in repeatedly handled fish. Our findings suggest that ethanol induced locomotor activity and anxiolysis is potentiated by handling stress and may be partially mediated by changes in dopaminergic and serotonergic activity. Overall, we demonstrate the validity of our repeated handling stressor paradigm for zebrafish, which can be used to investigate the interaction between stress and ethanol. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Psychotropic medications are widely used, and their prescription has increased worldwide, consequently increasing their presence in aquatic environments. Therefore, aquatic organisms can be exposed to psychotropic drugs that may be potentially dangerous, raising the question of whether these drugs are attractive or aversive to fish. To answer this question, adult zebrafish were tested in a chamber that allows the fish to escape or seek a lane of contaminated water. These attraction and aversion paradigms were evaluated by exposing the zebrafish to the presence of acute contamination with these compounds. The zebrafish were attracted by certain concentrations of diazepam, fluoxetine, risperidone and buspirone, which were most likely detected by olfaction, because this behavior was absent in anosmic fish. These findings suggest that despite their deleterious effects, certain psychoactive drugs attract fish. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Antiepileptic effects of diphenylhydantoin (DPH) have been documented in animal studies and clinical research, while little is known about the effects of the drug on basic behaviors and anxiety-related behaviors. In order to understand neuroactivities of DPH deeply and administrate DPH in clinic rationally, it is necessary to study neurobehavioral effects of the drug. In the present study, the effects of DPH on the locomotor activity and thigmotaxis of zebrafish larvae at 5. days post fertilization (dpf) were explored under different illumination conditions. The influence of DPH on zebrafish larval responses to visual stimuli (sudden illumination transition from light to dark) was also investigated. Under light or dark condition, exposure to high concentrations of DPH resulted in decreased locomotor activity and thigmotaxis, whereas DPH treatment at low doses enhanced the locomotor activity. Additionally, sudden illumination transition induced robust increase in the locomotor activity and this phenomenon was not modified by DPH treatment. Our results suggest that DPH has potential stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the locomotor activity and possesses anxiolytic properties. In addition, responses of 5-dpf zebrafish larvae to visual stimuli were not modified by DPH treatment. © 2015.

AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly emerging as an important model organism for aquatic neuropharmacology and toxicology research. The behavioral/phenotypic complexity of zebrafish allows for thorough dissection of complex human brain disorders and drug-evoked pathological states. As numerous zebrafish models become available with a wide spectrum of behavioral, genetic, and environmental methods to test novel drugs, here we discuss recent zebrafish phenomics methods to facilitate drug discovery, particularly in the field of biological psychiatry. Additionally, behavioral, neurological, and endocrine endpoints are becoming increasingly well-characterized in zebrafish, making them an inexpensive, robust and effective model for toxicology research and pharmacological screening. We also discuss zebrafish behavioral phenotypes, experimental considerations, pharmacological candidates and relevance of zebrafish neurophenomics to other 'omics' (e.g., genomic, proteomic) approaches. Finally, we critically evaluate the limitations of utilizing this model organism, and outline future strategies of research in the field of zebrafish phenomics. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have emerged as a popular model for studying the pharmacology and behavior of anxiety. While there have been numerous studies documenting the anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects of common drugs in zebrafish, many do not report or test for behavioral differences between the sexes. Previous studies have indicated that males and females differ in their baseline level of anxiety. In this study, we test for a sex interaction with fluoxetine and nicotine. We exposed fish to system water (control), 10 mg/L fluoxetine, or 1 mg/L nicotine for three minutes prior to being subjected to four minutes in an open-field drop test. Video recordings were tracked using ProAnalyst. Fish from both drug treatments reduced swimming speed, increased vertical position, and increased use of the top half of the open field when compared with the control, though fluoxetine had a larger effect on depth related behaviors while nicotine mostly affected swimming speed. A significant sex effect was observed where females swam at a slower and more constant speed than males, however neither drug produced a sex-dependent response. Copyright 2016 Singer et al.

AB  - The impact of mobile phone (MP) radiation on the brain is of specific interest to the scientific community and warrants investigations, as MP is held close to the head. Studies on humans and rodents revealed hazards MP radiation associated such as brain tumors, impairment in cognition, hearing etc. Melatonin (MT) is an important modulator of CNS functioning and is a neural antioxidant hormone. Zebrafish has emerged as a popular model organism for CNS studies. Herein, we evaluated the impact of GSM900MP (GSM900MP) radiation exposure daily for 1 hr for 14 days with the SAR of 1.34W/Kg on neurobehavioral and oxidative stress parameters in zebrafish. Our study revealed that, GSM900MP radiation exposure, significantly decreased time spent near social stimulus zone and increased total distance travelled, in social interaction test. In the novel tank dive test, the GSM900MP radiation exposure elicited anxiety as revealed by significantly increased time spent in bottom half; freezing bouts and duration and decreased distance travelled, average velocity, and number of entries to upper half of the tank. Exposed zebrafish spent less time in the novel arm of the Y-Maze, corroborating significant impairment in learning as compared to the control group. Exposure decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities whereas, increased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) was encountered showing compromised antioxidant defense. Treatment with MT significantly reversed the above neurobehavioral and oxidative derangements induced by GSM900MP radiation exposure. This study traced GSM900MP radiation exposure induced neurobehavioral aberrations and alterations in brain oxidative status. Furthermore, MT proved to be a promising therapeutic candidate in ameliorating such outcomes in zebrafish.

AB  - Pharmaceuticals are emerging contaminants as their worldwide consumption increases. Fibrates such as gemfibrozil (GEM) are used in human medicine to reduce blood concentrations of cholesterol and triacylglycerol and also are some of the most frequently reported pharmaceuticals in waste waters and surface waters. Despite some studies have already demonstrated the negative impact in physiological and/or reproductive endpoints in adult fish, data on survival and behavioral effects in fish larvae are lacking. This study aimed to assess the effects of GEM on zebrafish eleutheroembryo development and locomotor behavior. A fish embryo toxicity (FET) test was undertaken to evaluate GEM acute toxicity by exposing embryos to 0, 6.58, 9.87, 14.81, 22.22, 33.33 and 50mg/L. Developmental endpoints such as hatching success, edemas and malformations were recorded. A second test was undertaken by exposing embryos to 0, 1.5, 3 and 6mg/L in order to evaluate the effects of GEM on 120 and 144h post fertilization (hpf) larvae locomotor activity by video tracking, using a Zebrabox® (Viewpoint, France) device. From the data recorded, several parameters such as total swimming distance (TSD) and total swimming time (TST) in each 120s integration time were calculated. Data showed that this compound has a moderate toxic effect on fish embryo development, affecting both survival and hatching success with a calculated 96h LC50 of 11.01mg/L and no effects at the developmental level at 6mg/L. GEM seems to impair locomotor activity, even at concentrations where developmental abnormalities were unperceived, at concentrations as low as 1.5mg/L. Both TSD and TST were sensitive to GEM exposure. These effects do not seem to be independent of the developmental stage as 120hpf larvae seem to present a development bias with repercussions in locomotor behavior. This study highlights the need to include behavioral endpoints in ecotoxicological assays as this seems to be a more sensitive endpoint often disregarded. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Zebrafish have become a popular animal model for behavioral neuroscience with an increasing number of studies examining the effects of pharmacological compounds targeting the brain. Exposure to MK-801, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist has been shown to increase locomotor activity in zebrafish. However, others have failed to replicate this finding as several contradicting studies report no changes in locomotor activity following exposure to similar doses. In the current study we reconcile these behavioral reports by demonstrating that zebrafish do not exhibit changes in locomotor activity during exposure to non-sedative doses of MK-801. Interestingly, zebrafish do exhibit significant increases in locomotion if pre-treated with MK-801 followed by subsequent testing in a novel environment, which suggests the effects of MK-801 are context-dependent. In addition, we examine the potential role of the dopaminergic system in mediating MK-801's locomotor stimulant effect by quantifying the levels of dopamine and its metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the brains of zebrafish following a 30 min exposure to 10 μM of MK-801 (the dose found to induce the largest increase in locomotor activity). Our findings indicate that the MK-801-induced increase in locomotor activity is not accompanied by changes in whole-brain levels of dopamine or DOPAC. Overall, our results suggest that MK-801's context-dependent locomotor stimulant effect may be independent of whole-brain dopaminergic activation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Current advances in the ability to assay adult aquatic vertebrate behaviour are potentially very useful to aquatic toxicologists wishing to characterise the effects of pollutants on behaviour, cognition or neurodevelopment. This review considers two specific challenges faced by researchers wishing to exploit these technologies: maximising reliability and validity. It will suggest two behavioural procedures, with the potential for automation and high-throughput implementation, which can be used to measure social cohesion and anxiety, two areas of interest in behavioural aquatic toxicology. In addition, the review will make recommendations about how these procedures (and others) could be carried out to maximise reliability and validity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. The most toxic PCBs are the non-. ortho-substituted ("dioxin-like") congeners that act through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. In humans, perinatal exposure to dioxin-like PCBs is associated with neurodevelopmental toxicity in children. Yet, the full potential for later-life neurobehavioral effects that result from early-life low level exposure to dioxin-like PCBs is not well understood. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of developmental exposure to low levels of dioxin-like PCBs on early- and later-life behavioral phenotypes using zebrafish as a model system. We exposed zebrafish embryos to either vehicle (DMSO) or low concentrations of PCB126 (0.3, 0.6, 1.2. nM) for 20. h (4-24. h post fertilization), and then reared them to adulthood in clean water. Locomotor activity was tested at two larval stages (7 and 14 days post fertilization). Adult fish were tested for anxiety-related behavior using the novel tank and shoaling assays. Adult behavioral assays were repeated several times on the same group of fish and effects on intra- and inter-trial habituation were determined. While there was no effect of PCB126 on larval locomotor activity in response to changes in light conditions, developmental exposure to PCB126 resulted in impaired short- and long-term habituation to a novel environment in adult zebrafish. Cyp1a induction was measured as an indicator for AHR activation. Despite high induction at early stages, cyp1a expression was not induced in the brains of developmentally exposed adult fish that showed altered behavior, suggesting that AHR was not activated at this stage. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the zebrafish model in detecting subtle and delayed behavioral effects resulting from developmental exposure to an environmental contaminant. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Many opportunistic pathogens can alternate between inside- and outside-host environments during their life cycle. The opportunistic fish pathogen Flavobacterium columnare is an inhabitant of the natural microbial community and causes significant yearly losses in aquaculture worldwide. The bacterium grows in varying colony morphotypes that are associated with either virulence (rhizoid type) or resistance to starvation and phages (rough type). Rough type strains can arise spontaneously or can be induced by phage infection. To identify the determinants of morphotype fitness, we measured virulence, growth parameters, biofilm-forming ability and resistance to amoeba and ciliate predation of both morphotypes in thirteen F. columnare strains. The (phage-sensitive) rhizoid type had a fitness advantage over the rough type in virulence, growth rate and maximum population size. Phage-induced rough type was found to be significantly weakest in resisting both ciliate and amoeba predation, and produced more biofilm in the presence of amoebae, whereas the spontaneous rough types did not differ from rhizoid in biofilm production. In co-culture experiment, the ciliate population sizes were higher when co-cultured with rough type than with rhizoid type. Our results thus suggest that the resistance to phages and starvation of the F. columnare rough type may have strong a trade-off, as the performance of the ancestral rhizoid type is better under environmental conditions. Benefits of phage resistance and tolerance to starvation in the rough type of the fish pathogen Flavobacterium columnare are low and may indicate a trade-off from the better performance of the rhizoid type under environmental conditions. © 2014 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

AB  - Anxiety is a complex disorder; thus, its mechanisms remain unclear. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are a promising pharmacological model for anxiety research. Light/dark preference test is a behaviorally validated measure of anxiety in zebrafish; however, it requires pharmacological validation. We sought to evaluate the sensitivity of the light/dark preference test in adult zebrafish by immersing them in drug solutions containing clonazepam, buspirone, imipramine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, haloperidol, risperidone, propranolol, or ethanol. The time spent in the dark environment, the latency time to first crossing, and the number of midline crossings were analyzed. Intermediate concentrations of clonazepam administered for 600 s decreased the time spent in the dark and increased locomotor activity. Buspirone reduced motor activity. Imipramine and fluoxetine increased time spent in the dark and the first latency, and decreased the number of alternations. Paroxetine did not alter the time in the dark; however, it increased the first latency time and decreased locomotor activity. Haloperidol decreased the time spent in the dark at low concentrations. Risperidone and propranolol did not change any parameters. Ethanol reduced the time spent in the dark and increased the number of crossings at intermediate concentrations. These results corroborate the previous work using intraperitoneal drug administration in zebrafish and rodents, suggesting that water drug delivery in zebrafish can effectively be used as an animal anxiety model. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The development of vertebrate neurons requires a change in membrane phosphatidylcholine (PC) metabolism. Although PC hydrolysis is essential for enhanced axonal outgrowth mediated by phospholipase D (PLD), less is known about the determinants of PC metabolism on dendritic arborization. We show that protein arginine methyltransferase 8 (PRMT8) acts as a phospholipase that directly hydrolyzes PC, generating choline and phosphatidic acid. We found that PRMT8 knockout mice (prmt8-/-) displayed abnormal motor behaviors, including hindlimb clasping and hyperactivity. Moreover, prmt8-/-mice and TALEN-induced zebrafish prmt8 mutants and morphants showed abnormal phenotypes, including the development of dendritic trees in Purkinje cells and altered cerebellar structure. Choline and acetylcholine levels were significantly decreased, whereas PC levels were increased, in the cerebellum of prmt8-/-mice. Our findings suggest that PRMT8 acts both as an arginine methyltransferase and as a PC-hydrolyzing PLD that is essential for proper neurological functions. © 2015 The Authors, some rights reserved;.

AB  - Most existing pharmacological treatments have focused on the "monoamine hypothesis" for targeted drug design for major depressive disorder (MDD). Many of these medications have a delayed onset-of-action and limited efficacy. Antidepressants with principal targets outside the monoamine system may offer the potential for more rapid activity with improved therapeutic benefit. Growing evidence suggests that the glutamatergic system is uniquely central to the neurobiology and treatment of MDD. Ketamine (Ketalar®) is a non-competitive glutamatergic antagonist classically used to induce sedation. However, preliminary clinical evidence has been promising with regard to its rapidly acting antidepressant profile. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have emerged as a promising new animal model to screen the effects of numerous psychotropic compounds. This study aimed to determine if a sub-chronic low (sub-anesthetic) dose of ketamine could be used to augment the antidepressant effects of the widely used antidepressant fluoxetine (Prozac®) in adult zebrafish, employing an ethanol withdrawal model. Sub-chronic exposure to dosages of 100 μg/L fluoxetine and 20 mg/L of ketamine reduced anxiety/depression-like behaviors, leads to upregulation of serotonin synthesis and elevated whole-body cortisol levels. These results demonstrate the utility of zebrafish as a model for neuropharmacological research, and the possible efficacy of fluoxetine and ketamine coadministration. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Despite the recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders, the pharmacological treatments currently available are limited in efficacy and induce serious side effects. A possible strategy to achieve clinical benefits is drug repurposing, i.e., discovery of novel applications for old drugs, bringing new treatment options to the market and to the patients who need them. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a commonly used mucolytic and paracetamol antidote, has emerged as a promising molecule for the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders. The mechanism of action of this drug is complex, and involves modulation of antioxidant, inflammatory, neurotrophic and glutamate pathways. Here we evaluated the effects of NAC on behavioral parameters relevant to anxiety in zebrafish. NAC did not alter behavioral parameters in the novel tank test, prevented the anxiety-like behaviors induced by an acute stressor (net chasing), and increased the time zebrafish spent in the lit side in the light/dark test. These data may indicate that NAC presents an anti-stress effect, with the potential to prevent stress-induced psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. The considerable homology between mammalian and zebrafish genomes invests the current data with translational validity for the further clinical trials needed to substantiate the use of NAC in anxiety disorders. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Expanding the spectrum of organisms to model human brain phenotypes is critical for our improved understanding of the pathobiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Given the clear limitations of existing mammalian models, there is an urgent need for low-cost, high-throughput in-vivo technologies for drug and gene discovery. New method: Here, we introduce a new automated method for generating 3D (X,Y,Z) swim trajectories in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio), to improve their neurophenotyping. Results: Based on the Track3D module of EthoVision XT video tracking software (Noldus Information Technology), this tool enhances the efficient, high-throughput 3D analyses of zebrafish behavioral responses. Applied to adult zebrafish behavior, this 3D method is highly sensitive to various classes of psychotropic drugs, including selected psychostimulant and hallucinogenic agents. Comparison with existing Methods: Our present method offers a marked advance in the existing 2D and 3D methods of zebrafish behavioral phenotyping, minimizing research time and recording high-resolution, automatically synchronized videos with calculated, high-precision object positioning. Conclusions: Our novel approach brings practical simplicity and 'integrative' capacity to the often complex and error-prone quantification of zebrafish behavioral phenotypes. Illustrating the value of 3D swim path reconstructions for identifying experimentally-evoked phenotypic profiles, this method fosters innovative, ethologically relevant, and fully automated small molecule screens using adult zebrafish. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) have grown in usage since concerns about the health effects of the previously used polybrominated flame retardants led to their being phased out. The potential for OPFRs to cause adverse health effects of their own is still unexamined. Because of their structural similarities to organophosphate pesticides, which have themselves been heavily researched and shown to be neurobehavioral teratogens, we investigated the possibility that developmental exposure to two OPFRs, triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), and tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl)phosphate (TDCIPP) might lead to behavioral impairment across the lifespan, as has been observed with the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos. Methods: Zebrafish were exposed to 0.03 or 0.3 μM of TPHP, TDCIPP, or chlorpyrifos from 0 to 5 days post fertilization. Vehicle control consisted of 0.03% solution of DMSO. At 6 days post fertilization, larvae were tested on a locomotor assay. Separate cohorts of 6 day old larvae that were not tested on the larval assay were allowed to grow to adulthood. At 12 weeks post fertilization, these adult zebrafish were tested on a battery of behavioral assays that included tests of novel environment exploration, startle habituation, social affiliation, and predator escape. Results: Developmental exposure altered zebrafish behavior across the lifespan. Larval zebrafish exposed to the 0.03 μM doses of chlorpyrifos or TDCIPP exhibited significant (p < 0.05) hyperactivity in the locomotor assay. Organophosphate exposure significantly (p < 0.05) altered the time course of adult zebrafish behavior in the novel environment, startle habituation, and social affiliation assays. Predator escape behavior was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in fish exposed to the 0.3 μM dose of TDCIPP. Exposure also caused hyperactivity in adult fish, with fish exposed to the 0.3 μM dose of TDCIPP exhibiting significantly (p < 0.05) elevated locomotor behavior in the novel environment assay. Discussion: Early developmental exposure to OPFRs produced behavioral impairment that persisted into adulthood. These findings support broader research investigating the role of organophosphate compounds, including the OPFRs used here, in developmental neurotoxicity. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Winner–loser relations among group-living individuals are often measured by the levels of aggressive interactions between them. These interactions are typically driven by competition for resources such as food and mates. It has been observed in recent studies on zebrafish that dominant males generally have higher total reproductive success than their less aggressive subordinate counterparts. This study aimed to test whether males who monopolized a food resource (winners) also displayed higher levels of aggression than the males who were unsuccessful (losers). Further, the study also tested whether the same ‘winner’ males were also able to monopolize interactions with females during courtship. The results from these experiments showed that while males monopolizing food resources (winners) demonstrated higher levels of agonistic interactions than the losers, the average number of courtship interactions initiated by either of the males (i.e. winners/losers) with a female was not significantly different. A significant relationship was obtained between the number of aggressive interactions and feeding latencies of males in the context of food monopolization. This indicated that there could be a linkage between boldness defined by feeding latency in a novel environment and agonistic responses. The probable role of nature of resources, resource availability and distribution in determining the outcomes of dyadic contests is discussed. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Ketamine, a pediatric anesthetic, is a noncompetitive N-methyl- d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist. Studies show that ketamine is neurotoxic in developing mammals and zebrafish. In both mammals and zebrafish, acetyl l-carnitine (ALCAR) has been shown to be protective against ketamine toxicity. Ketamine is known to modulate the serotonergic system in mammals. Here, we measured the levels of serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the embryos exposed to ketamine in the presence and absence of ALCAR. Ketamine, at lower doses, did not produce significant changes in the 5-HT or 5-HIAA levels in 3 dpf (day post-fertilization) embryos. However, 2. mM ketamine (internal embryo exposure levels comparable to human anesthetic plasma concentration) significantly reduced 5-HT level, and 5-HIAA was not detectable indicating that 5-HT metabolism was abolished. In the presence or absence of 2. mM ketamine, ALCAR by itself did not significantly alter 5-HT or 5-HIAA levels compared to the control. Ratios of metabolite/5-HT indicated that 2. mM ketamine inhibited 5-HT metabolism to 5-HIAA whereas lower doses (0.1-0.3. mM) of ketamine did not have any effect. ALCAR reversed the effects of 2. mM ketamine not only by restoring 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels but also 5-HT turnover rate to control levels. Whole mount immunohistochemical studies showed that 2. mM ketamine reduced the serotonergic area in the brain whereas ALCAR expanded it with increased axonal sprouting and branching. These results indicate that ketamine and ALCAR have opposing effects on the zebrafish serotonergic system. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Rationale: The zebrafish has become an increasingly popular animal model for investigating ethanol's actions in the brain and its effects on behavior. Acute exposure to ethanol in zebrafish has been shown to induce a dose-dependent increase of locomotor activity, to reduce fear- and anxiety-related behavioral responses, and to increase the levels of dopamine and its metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). Objectives: The objective of the present study was to investigate the role of dopamine D1 receptors (D1-R) in ethanol-induced locomotor activity in zebrafish. Methods: Zebrafish were pre-treated with SCH-23390 (0 or 1 mg/L bath concentration), a D1-R antagonist, and subsequently exposed to ethanol (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 % v/v). To explore potential underlying mechanisms, we quantified levels of dopamine, DOPAC, serotonin, and 5-HIAA from whole-brain tissue using high-precision liquid chromatography. Results: We found pre-treatment with the D1-R antagonist to attenuate locomotor activity independent of ethanol concentration. Furthermore, unlike ethanol, D1-R antagonism did not alter behavioral responses associated with fear and anxiety. Pre-treatment with SCH-23390 decreased levels of dopamine and DOPAC, but this effect was also independent of ethanol concentration. The D1-R antagonist also reduced serotonin and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) levels. Conclusion: These results suggest a multifaceted and at least partially independent role of dopamine D1 receptors in ethanol-induced locomotor activity and anxiety-related responses as well as in the functioning of the dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems in zebrafish. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The role of thyroid hormones in vertebrate development has been well documented for several decades. As hypothyroidism during critical periods of development can cause defects to the development of every major organ system, including brain, eye, and general morphology, we hypothesized that hypothyroidism would affect specific behaviors. To assess this, we treated zebrafish with the hypothyroid drug methimazole (MMI) and examined changes in anxiety, shoaling, vision, and locomotion. Following low-dose MMI exposure for the first 10 days of life, a time of rapid and significant development, larvae were removed from treatment and allowed to develop until 1 month of age. Comparisons between treated and controls took place between 10 and 30 days postfertilization to examine times both during and after treatment. Using the novel tank and startle response tests, we found that anxiety behaviors are significantly increased following MMI treatment. These effects persisted for several days following removal from treatment and indicate a prolonged effect of early hypothyroidism. However, permanent MMI effects on anxiety were not observed, as anxiety behaviors of early treated zebrafish recovered to control levels following 10 days out of treatment. In contrast to the strong link between MMI treatment and anxiety, shoaling and visual behaviors were not significantly affected within our experimental parameters. This indicates that disruption of thyroid system functioning early in life can differentially affect behavior by specifically altering anxiety responses without producing indiscriminate changes to overall behavioral development. © 2015 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Animals communicate through the exchange of signals. However, third-party individuals can detect and intercept signals not directly sent to them, a phenomenon known as eavesdropping, and the presence of bystanders can influence the signalling behaviour of interacting conspecifics, a phenomenon named the audience effect. So far, research done on audience effects and eavesdropping has been mainly focused on their function, rather than on their proximate mechanisms. For this reason, we were interested in testing the occurrence of audience effects on male zebrafish, a genetically tractable model organism that is emerging as a major candidate for the study of the neural basis of social behaviour. Here, pairs of males were exposed to a mixed-sex shoal, which was used as an audience, at two different times: (1) during a contest between them, to test for an audience effect and (2) before the contest, to test whether this prior exposure influences subsequent agonistic behaviour (i.e. aggressive priming). We analysed the pairs' aggressive signalling during the contest by measuring variables that characterize both the individuals' behaviour and the interaction, and found that pre-exposure to an audience induced a shorter latency to display, an increase in the time dominants spent chasing subordinates and a shorter time to resolve the agonistic interaction. Also, exposure to the audience during the interaction led to a higher number of interactions in which displays occurred, a higher number of resolved interactions with displays and a decrease in the escalation of aggression for resolved interactions. These results add zebrafish to the literature on the audience effect and, most importantly, open the way for the study of the neural mechanisms involved in the processing of social information in a model organism. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - In zebrafish the medial pallium of the dorsal telencephalon represents an amygdala homolog structure, which is crucially involved in emotional associative learning and memory. Similar to the mammalian amygdala, the medial pallium contains a high density of endocannabinoid receptor CB1. To elucidate the role of the zebrafish endocannabinoid system in associative learning, we tested the influence of acute and chronic administration of receptor agonists (THC, WIN55,212-2) and antagonists (Rimonabant, AM-281) on two different learning paradigms. In an appetitively motivated two-alternative choice paradigm, animals learned to associate a certain color with a food reward. In a second set-up, a fish shuttle-box, animals associated the onset of a light stimulus with the occurrence of a subsequent electric shock (avoidance conditioning). Once fish successfully had learned to solve these behavioral tasks, acute receptor activation or inactivation had no effect on memory retrieval, suggesting that established associative memories were stable and not alterable by the endocannabinoid system. In both learning tasks, chronic treatment with receptor antagonists improved acquisition learning, and additionally facilitated reversal learning during color discrimination. In contrast, chronic CB1 activation prevented aversively motivated acquisition learning, while different effects were found on appetitively motivated acquisition learning. While THC significantly improved behavioral performance, WIN55,212-2 significantly impaired color association. Our findings suggest that the zebrafish endocannabinoid system can modulate associative learning and memory. Stimulation of the CB1 receptor might play a more specific role in acquisition and storage of aversive learning and memory, while CB1 blocking induces general enhancement of cognitive functions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anxiety is a complex disorder; thus, its mechanisms remain unclear. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are a promising pharmacological model for anxiety research. Light/dark preference test is a behaviorally validated measure of anxiety in zebrafish; however, it requires pharmacological validation. We sought to evaluate the sensitivity of the light/dark preference test in adult zebrafish by immersing them in drug solutions containing clonazepam, buspirone, imipramine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, haloperidol, risperidone, propranolol, or ethanol. The time spent in the dark environment, the latency time to first crossing, and the number of midline crossings were analyzed. Intermediate concentrations of clonazepam administered for 600 s decreased the time spent in the dark and increased locomotor activity. Buspirone reduced motor activity. Imipramine and fluoxetine increased time spent in the dark and the first latency, and decreased the number of alternations. Paroxetine did not alter the time in the dark; however, it increased the first latency time and decreased locomotor activity. Haloperidol decreased the time spent in the dark at low concentrations. Risperidone and propranolol did not change any parameters. Ethanol reduced the time spent in the dark and increased the number of crossings at intermediate concentrations. These results corroborate the previous work using intraperitoneal drug administration in zebrafish and rodents, suggesting that water drug delivery in zebrafish can effectively be used as an animal anxiety model. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Biological early warning systems (BEWS) are becoming very important tools in ecotoxicological studies because they can detect changes in the behavior of organisms exposed to toxic substances. In this work, a video tracking system was fully developed to detect the presence of commercial bleach (NaOCl) in water in three different concentrations (0.0005%; 0.0010% and 0.0020% (v/v)) during one hour of exposure. Zebrafish was selected as the test organism because it is widely used in many different areas and studies. Two distinct statistical models were developed, using probabilistic neural network (PNN) and correspondence analysis associated with self-organizing map (SOM-CA). The diagnosis was based only in the analysis of a few behavioral components of the fish, namely: mean angular velocity, mean linear velocity, spatial dispersion, mean value of the X coordinate and mean value of the Y coordinate. Both models showed good results in their diagnosis capabilities. However, the overall performance (accuracy) was always superior in the PNN model. The worst result was with the SOM-CA model, at the lowest concentration (0.0005% v/v), achieving only 65% of correct diagnosis. The best result was with the PNN model, at the highest concentration (0.0020% v/v), achieving 94% of correct diagnosis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Zebrafish has been recently proposed as a valid animal model to investigate the fundamental mechanisms regulating emotional behavior and evaluate the modulatory effects exerted by psychoactive compounds. In this study, we propose a novel methodological framework based on robotics and information theory to investigate the behavioral response of zebrafish exposed to acute caffeine treatment. In a binary preference test, we studied the response of caffeine-treated zebrafish to a replica of a shoal of conspecifics moving in the tank. A purely data-driven information theoretic approach was used to infer the influence of the replica on zebrafish behavior as a function of caffeine concentration. Our results demonstrate that acute caffeine administration modulates both the average speed and the interaction with the replica. Specifically, zebrafish exposed to elevated doses of caffeine show reduced locomotion and increased sensitivity to the motion of the replica. The methodology developed in this study may complement traditional experimental paradigms developed in the field of behavioral pharmacology. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Group living animals may eavesdrop on signalling interactions between conspecifics and integrate it with their own past social experience in order to optimize the use of relevant information from others. However, little is known about this interplay between public (eavesdropped) and private social information. To investigate it, we first manipulated the dominance status of bystander zebrafish. Next, we either allowed or prevented bystanders from observing a fight. Finally, we assessed their behaviour towards the winners and losers of the interaction, using a custom-made video-tracking system and directional analysis. We found that only dominant bystanders who had seen the fight revealed a significant increase in directional focus (a measure of attention) towards the losers of the fights. Furthermore, our results indicate that information about the fighters' acquired status was collected from the signalling interaction itself and not from post-interaction status cues, which implies the existence of individual recognition in zebrafish. Thus, we show for the first time that zebrafish, a highly social model organism, eavesdrop on conspecific agonistic interactions and that this process is modulated by the eavesdroppers' dominance status. We suggest that this type of integration of public and private information may be ubiquitous in social learning processes. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Light plays a key role in synchronizing rhythms and setting the phase of early development. However, to date, little is known about the impact of light wavelengths during the ontogeny of the molecular clock and the behavioural rhythmicity. The aim of this research was to determine the effect of light of different wavelengths (white, blue and red) on the onset of locomotor activity and clock gene (per1b, per2, clock1, bmal1 and dbp) expression rhythms. For this purpose, 4 groups of zebrafish embryo/larvae were raised from 0 to 7 days post-fertilization (dpf) under the following lighting conditions: Three groups maintained under light:dark (LD) cycles with white (full visible spectrum, LDW), blue (LDB), or red light (LDR), and one group raised under constant darkness (DD). The results showed that lighting conditions influenced activity rhythms. Larvae were arrhythmic under DD, while under LD cycles they developed wavelength-dependent daily activity rhythms which appeared earlier under LDB (4 dpf) than under LDWor LDR (5 dpf). The results also revealed that development and lighting conditions influenced clock gene expression. While clock1 rhythmic expression appeared in all lighting conditions at 7 dpf, per1b, per2 and dbp showed daily variations already at 3 dpf. Curiously, bmal1 showed consistent rhythmic expression from embryonic stage (0 dpf). Summarizing, the data revealed that daily rhythms appeared earlier in the larvae reared under LDB than in those reared under LDW and LDR. These results emphasize the importance of lighting conditions and wavelengths during early development for the ontogeny of daily rhythms of gene expression and how these rhythms are reflected on the behavioural rhythmicity of zebrafish larvae. © 2015 Di Rosa et al.

AB  - Since its identification in 2000, sulfotransferase (SULT) 4A1 has presented an enigma to the field of cytosolic SULT biology. SULT4A1 is exclusively expressed in neural tissue, is highly conserved, and has been identified in every vertebrate studied to date. Despite this singular level of conservation, no substrate or function for SULT4A1 has been identified. Previous studies demonstrated that SULT4A1 does not bind the obligate sulfate donor, 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate, yet SULT4A1 is classified as a SULT superfamily member based on sequence and structural similarities to the other SULTs. In this study, transcription activator-like effector nucleases were used to generate heritable mutations in the SULT4A1 gene of zebrafish. The mutation (SULT4A1Δ8) consists of an 8-nucleotide deletion within the second exon of the gene, resulting in a frameshift mutation and premature stop codon after 132 AA. During early adulthood, casual observations were made that mutant zebrafish were exhibiting excessively sedentary behavior during the day. These observations were inconsistent with published reports on activity in zebrafish that are largely diurnal organisms and are highly active during the day. Thus, a decrease in activity during the day represents an abnormal behavior and warranted further systematic analysis. EthoVision video tracking software was used to monitor activity levels in wild-type (WT) and SULT4A1Δ8/Δ8 fish over 48 hours of a normal light/dark cycle. SULT4A1Δ8/Δ8 fish were shown to exhibit increased inactivity bout length and frequency as well as a general decrease in daytime activity levels when compared with their WT counterparts.

AB  - Zebrafish is emerging as a species of choice in alcohol-related pharmacological studies. In these studies, zebrafish are often exposed to acute ethanol treatments and their activity scored during behavioral assays. Computational modeling of zebrafish behavior is expected to positively impact these efforts by offering a predictive toolbox to plan hypothesis-driven studies, reduce the number of subjects, perform pilot trials, and refine behavioral screening. In this work, we demonstrate the use of the recently proposed jump persistent turning walker to model the turning rate dynamics of zebrafish exposed to acute ethanol administration. This modeling framework is based on a stochastic mean reverting jump process to capture the sudden and large changes in orientation of swimming zebrafish. The model is calibrated on an available experimental dataset of 40 subjects, tested at different ethanol concentrations. We demonstrate that model parameters are modulated by ethanol administration, whereby both the relaxation rate and jump frequency of the turning rate dynamics are influenced by ethanol concentration. This effort offers a first evidence for the possibility of complementing zebrafish pharmacological research with computational modeling of animal behavior. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Recently, we established an inhibitory avoidance paradigm in Tupfel Long-Fin (TL) zebrafish. Here, we compared task performance of TL fish and fish from the AB strain; another widely used strain and shown to differ genetically and behaviourally from TL fish. Whole-body cortisol and telencephalic gene expression related to stress, anxiety and fear were measured before and 2 h post-task. Inhibitory avoidance was assessed in a 3-day paradigm: fish learn to avoid swimming from a white to a black compartment where a 3V-shock is given: day 1 (first shock), day 2 (second shock) and day 3 (no shock, sampling). Tupfel Long-Fin fish rapidly learned to avoid the black compartment and showed an increase in avoidance-related spatial behaviour in the white compartment across days. In contrast, AB fish showed no inhibitory avoidance learning. AB fish had higher basal cortisol levels and expression levels of stress-axis related genes than TL fish. Tupfel Long-Fin fish showed post-task learning-related changes in cortisol and gene expression levels, but these responses were not seen in AB fish. We conclude that AB fish show higher cortisol levels and no inhibitory avoidance than TL fish. The differential learning responses of these Danio strains may unmask genetically defined risks for stress-related disorders. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society.

AB  - Environmental enrichment provides laboratory-housed species the opportunity to express natural behavior and exert control over their home environment, thereby minimizing stress. We sought to determine whether providing an artificial plant in the holding tank as enrichment influenced anxiety-like behaviors and place-preference choice in adult zebrafish. Fish were housed singly or in social groups of 5 for 3 wk in 1 of 4 experimental housing environments: single-housed enriched (n = 30), single-housed barren (n = 30), group-housed enriched (n = 30), and group-housed barren (n = 30). On week 4, individual fish were selected randomly from each of the experimental housing environments and tested by using novel-tank, light-dark, and place-preference tests. Housing fish singly in a barren environment increased anxiety-like behaviors in the novel-tank and light-dark behavioral tests. Single-housed zebrafish in barren tanks as well as zebrafish group-housed with conspecifics, both with and without plant enrichment, spent more time associating with conspecifics than with the artificial plant enrichment device during the place-preference test. Single-housed fish maintained in enriched tanks displayed no preference between a compartment with conspecifics or an artificial plant. Our results suggest the addition of an artificial plant as enrichment may benefit single-housed zebrafish when social housing is not possible.

AB  - The assessment of shoaling in adult zebrafish is technically difficult, but important, given their social nature. The present study aimed to characterize a new protocol using simple automated tracking software to evaluate general behavior and social interaction simultaneously. To this end, we used a single tank with a central transparent glass division and placed one zebrafish on each side for 5 min. This strategy allows fish to interact visually at the same time that individual automated evaluation of behavior can be easily performed. Our results showed that, when two fish are placed side-by-side, there is an increase in their height in the tank compared with isolated fish and they remain close to each other. The pharmacological treatments with benzodiazepines (bromazepam and clonazepam) and the serotonergic drugs buspirone, fluoxetine, and escitalopram did not affect locomotion at the concentrations tested, except for the highest concentration of buspirone. Nevertheless, benzodiazepines increased interfish distance (i.e. reduced shoaling behavior) and serotonergic drugs elevated height in the tank. These results support the use of the side-by-side exploratory test for behavioral studies with the zebrafish, including high-throughput behavioral screening for antidepressants and anxiolytics.

AB  - Background: Neonicotinoid insecticides are becoming more widely applied as organophosphate (OP) insecticides are decreasing in use. Because of their relative specificity to insect nicotinic receptors, they are thought to have reduced risk of neurotoxicity in vertebrates. However, there is scant published literature concerning the neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure of vertebrates to neonicotinoids. Methods: Using zebrafish, we investigated the neurobehavioral effects of developmental exposure to imidacloprid, a prototypic neonicotinoid pesticide. Nicotine was also administered for comparison. Zebrafish were exposed via immersion in aqueous solutions containing 45. μM or 60. μM of imidacloprid or nicotine (or vehicle control) from 4. h to 5. d post fertilization. The functional effects of developmental exposure to both imidacloprid and nicotine were assessed in larvae using an activity assay and during adolescence and adulthood using a battery of neurobehavioral assays, including assessment of sensorimotor response and habituation in a tactile startle test, novel tank swimming, and shoaling behavior. Results: In larvae, developmental imidacloprid exposure at both doses significantly decreased swimming activity. The 5D strains of zebrafish were more sensitive to both nicotine and imidacloprid than the AB* strain. In adolescent and adult fish, developmental exposure to imidacloprid significantly decreased novel tank exploration and increased sensorimotor response to startle stimuli. While nicotine did not affect novel tank swimming, it increased sensorimotor response to startle stimuli at the low dose. No effects of either compound were found on shoaling behavior or habituation to a startling stimulus. Discussion: Early developmental exposure to imidacloprid has both early-life and persisting effects on neurobehavioral function in zebrafish. Its developmental neurotoxicity should be further investigated. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The Rest/Nrsf transcriptional repressor modulates expression of a large set of neural specific genes. Many of these target genes have well characterized roles in nervous system processes including development, plasticity and synaptogenesis. However, the impact of Rest-mediated transcriptional regulation on behavior has been understudied due in part to the embryonic lethality of the mouse knockout. To investigate the requirement for Rest in behavior, we employed the zebrafish rest mutant to explore a range of behaviors in adults and larva. Adult rest mutants of both sexes showed abnormal behaviors in a novel environment including increased vertical swimming, erratic swimming patterns and a proclivity for the tank walls. Adult males also had diminished reproductive success. At 6 days post fertilization (dpf), rest mutant larva were hypoactive, but displayed normal evoked responses to light and sound stimuli. Overall, these results provide evidence that rest dysfunction produces atypical swimming patterns and preferences in adults, and reduced locomotor activity in larvae. This study provides the first behavioral analysis of rest mutants and reveals specific behaviors that are modulated by Rest. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Plastic responses can have adaptive significance for organisms occurring in unpredictable environments, migratory species and organisms occupying novel environments. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) occur in a wide range of habitats and environments that fluctuate frequently across seasons and habitats. We expect wild populations of fish to be behaviorally more flexible than fish reared in conventional laboratory and hatchery environments. We measured three behavioral traits among 2 wild (U and PN) and 1 laboratory bred (SH) zebrafish populations in four environments differing in water flow and vegetation regimes. We found that the degree of plasticity varied with the type of behavior and also among populations. In general, vegetation increased aggression and water flow decreased latency to feed after a disturbance, but the patterns were population dependent. For example, while wild U fish fed more readily after a disturbance in vegetated and/or flowing habitats, fish from the wild PN population and lab-reared SH strain showed little variation in foraging across different environmental conditions. Zebrafish from all the three populations were more aggressive when tested in an arena with vegetation. In contrast, while there was an inter-population difference in shoaling distances, variation in shoaling distance across environmental conditions within populations was not significant. These results suggest that both foraging and aggression in zebrafish are more plastic and influenced by immediate context than is shoaling distance, which may have a stronger genetic basis. Our findings point to different underlying mechanisms influencing the expression of these traits and warrants further investigations.

AB  - Objectves: The objective of our present research investigation was to evaluate the effectiveness of the aquatic white/black plus maze model to evaluate the efficacy of different treatment drugs on zebra fish behavior studies. Methods: Animals were divided into three groups each containing six animals. The first two groups were pretreated with lower and higher doses of midazolam and then they were exposed to unfamiliar environments of aquatic white/black plus maze. The last group of animals was only immersed into the unknown familiar in the form of aquatic white/black plus maze without any pretreatment of the drugs. Results: The results illustrated that the pretreatment drugs certainly improved the behavior status of the animal in the form of releasing anxiety and stress, but the doses of different pretreatment have no significant effects on improvement of behavioral status. Conclusion: In conclusion, it can be described that this model is highly effective to find the proper drug for the treatment of anxiety but it is not so effective to find the proper dose of treatment. © 2015, Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research.

AB  - The high prevalence of brain disorders and the lack of their efficient treatments necessitate improved in-vivo pre-clinical models and tests. The zebrafish (Danio rerio), a vertebrate species with high genetic and physiological homology to humans, is an excellent organism for innovative central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery and small molecule screening. Here, we outline new strategies for developing higher-throughput zebrafish screens to test neuroactive drugs and predict their pharmacological mechanisms. With the growing application of automated 3D phenotyping, machine learning algorithms, movement pattern- and behavior recognition, and multi-animal video-tracking, zebrafish screens are expected to markedly improve CNS drug discovery. © 2015 Stewart, Gerlai and Kalueff.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) and serotonin (5-HT) interact at the molecular and systems levels to control behavioral variables, including agression, fear, and reactions to novelty. In zebrafish, the 5-HT1B receptor has been implicated in anxiety and reactions to novelty, while the 5-HT1A receptor is associated with anxiety-like behavior; this role of the 5-HT1A receptor is mediated by NO. This work investigated whether NO also participates in the mediation of novelty responses by the 5-HT1B receptor. The 5-HT1B receptor inverse agonist SB 224,289 decreased bottom-dwelling and erratic swimming in zebrafish; the effects on bottom-dwelling, but not on erratic swimming, were blocked by pre-treatment with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME. These effects underline a novel mechanism by which 5-HT controls zebrafish reactivity to novel environments, with implications for the study of neotic reactions, exploratory behavior, and anxiety-like states. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Here, we show that individually housed zebrafish presented a reduced cortisol response to an acute stressor (persecution with a pen net for 120. s) compared to zebrafish housed in groups of 10. We hypothesized that the cortisol response to stress was reduced in individually housed zebrafish because they depend solely on their own perceptions of the stressor, whereas among grouped zebrafish, the stress response might be augmented by chemical and/or behavioral cues from the other members of the shoal. This hypothesis was based on previous described chemical communication of stress in fish as well on individual variation in stressor perception and potential individual differences in fish personality. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The inhibitory avoidance paradigm allows the study of mechanisms underlying learning and memory formation in zebrafish (Danio rerio Hamilton). For zebrafish, the physiology and behavior associated with this paradigm are as yet poorly understood. We therefore assessed the effects of environmental enrichment and fish age on inhibitory avoidance learning. Fish raised in an environmentally enriched tank showed decreased anxiety-like behavior and increased exploration. Enrichment greatly reduced inhibitory avoidance in 6-month (6M)-and 12-month (12M)-old fish. Following inhibitory avoidance, telencephalic mRNA levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna), neurogenic differentiation (neurod), cocaine-and amphetamine-regulated transcript 4 (cart4), and cannabinoid receptor 1 (cnr1) were lower in enriched-housed fish, while the ratios of mineralocorticoid receptor (nr3c2)/glucocorticoid receptor α [nr3c1(α)] and glucocorticoid receptor β [nr3c1(β)]/glucocorticoid receptor α [nr3c1(α)] were higher. This was observed for 6M-old fish only, not for 24-month (24M) old fish. Instead, 24M-old fish showed delayed inhibitory avoidance, no effects of enrichment, and reduced expression of neuroplasticity genes. Overall, our data show strong differences in inhibitory avoidance behavior between zebrafish of different ages and a clear reduction in avoidance behavior following housing under environmental enrichment. © 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the welfare of ornamental fish. Diet can significantly impact the welfare of fish, which can manifest as changes in the fish's physical health and behavior. The zebrafish, Danio rerio, is a popular ornamental species; however, little is known about their nutritional requirements with possible implications for their welfare. Here, we investigated the effect of diets with increasing crude protein (iso-caloric diets) and lipid (iso-nitrogenous diets) on the growth performance, oxygen consumption, and behavior of zebrafish. We found no significant effects of crude protein (32%-75%) or lipid (8%-16%) on the specific growth rate or oxygen consumption of fish fed 5% of their body mass (BM)/day, although the highest crude protein and lipid diet resulted in an increase in condition factor. Furthermore, the crude protein diets did not affect zebrafish behavior when fed a 2% BM ration, once a day. This study has shown that a diet with 32% crude protein and a diet with 8% crude lipid, when fed at a 5% BM ration, were sufficient to meet the growth requirements of our zebrafish. These diets supported the fish's physical health and thus benefited their welfare. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.

AB  - Zebrafish are still a relatively new, but promising, model organism and increasingly used in behavioral studies. This chapter reviews some of the behavioral paradigms that show promise in behavioral neuroscience as it applies to pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) of the brain, such as autism. Predictive and high-throughput animal models of cognition and behavior are increasingly more important in translational neuroscience research and zebrafish could be an excellent tool in this area. The zebrafish' complex behavioral repertoire, its size, relative low cost, short generation time, and high homology with higher vertebrates make it an excellent model organism. Rodents have traditionally been used to study complex cognitive phenotypes. However, it is particularly the physical features of zebrafish (small size, short generation time) that make it an appealing model to complement the progress made in the rodent literature. Taking into account that no single animal model can recapitulate all aspects of human behaviors impaired in pervasive brain disorders, using zebrafish to complement existing efforts using different models may open up new avenues of discovery not previously explored. While promising, zebrafish are a new model and many existing paradigms are being translated to the zebrafish larval and adult model. This chapter aims to discuss various important behavioral paradigms and how they relate to the study of PDDs. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.

AB  - Zebrafish are a promising new model for the study of neurological development. The effects of small molecule exposure, genetic manipulation, mutations, or other treatments can be observed on a morphological level in the developing organism. In addition, by utilizing transgenic fish lines that express fluorescent marker proteins in specific neuronal subpopulations, changes in brain development can be monitored at a cellular level. Moreover, after visualizing brain development, consequent alterations in behavior can be measured in the adult fish. In 2003, Tropepe and Sive first proposed using zebrafish as a model for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), using a genetic screen to investigate reduced ventricular development, an ASD endophenotpye (Tropepe and Sive, Genes Brain Behav 2:268–281, 2003). Since that initial proposal, numerous studies have proven zebrafish to be a useful and unique model for the study of numerous aspects of ASD, Prader-Willi syndrome, and related disorders. Dysfunction of the oxytocin system has been implicated in all three of these disorders. We have developed transgenic zebrafish expressing green florescent protein in oxytocin-producing neurons. This enables visualization of perturbations in the oxytocinergic system, allowing the detection of new connections and structures, and correlation to altered adult behavior. This chapter presents a general protocol for utilizing zebrafish for studies of neurodevelopmental disorders based on pharmacologic manipulation and observation of embryonic brain development, followed by behavioral analyses once the fish mature. These procedures assume no specialized facilities or equipment for zebrafish studies, and are intended to provide an entry point for preliminary studies conducted by investigators with little to no experience with this amazing model organism. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The zebrafish is emerging as a popular animal model for alcohol (ethanol or EtOH) addiction due to its simplicity and practical advantages. Two phenomena associated with ethanol addiction are the development of tolerance and withdrawal. Using a multi-level approach in the current study, we characterise ethanol tolerance and withdrawal in zebrafish. We first investigate the temporal trajectory of ethanol concentration in the zebrafish brain in response to an acute exposure and during withdrawal. We report that ethanol concentrations approach a steady state within 60. min of exposure to 0.50% and 1.00% v/v ethanol and rapidly decline and return to zero within 60. min following withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure (0.50% v/v). We characterise the changes associated with ethanol tolerance and withdrawal in zebrafish by focusing on three domains relevant to ethanol addiction: motor patterns, physiological responses (i.e. cortisol levels), and neurochemical alterations. The use of multiple domains of investigation allowed an in-depth analysis of ethanol induced changes in zebrafish. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - NMDA receptors have been implicated in the acute response to stress, possibly mediated the nitric oxide pathway; serotonin has also been implicated in these responses, and has recently been shown to modulate the nitric oxide pathway via 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors. In this work, we compare the effects of NMDA and a 5-HT1A receptor ligands on light/dark preference in adult zebrafish, and investigate whether nitric oxide mediates the effects of such drugs. The noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 decreased dark preference (scototaxis), while NMDA increased it; the effects of NMDA were completely blocked by pretreatment with the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) antagonist L-NAME. SNP, a nitric oxide donor, produced a bell-shaped dose-response profile on scototaxis. Treatment with 5-HTP increased scototaxis, an effect which was potentiated by pre-treatment with NMDA, but not MK-801, and partially blocked by L-NAME. The 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100,635 decreased scototaxis, an effect which was completely blocked by L-NAME. These results suggest that tonic NOS inhibition is an important downstream effector of 5-HT1A receptors in the regulation of dark preference behavior in zebrafish, and that NOS is also under phasic independent control by NMDA receptors. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Zebrafish are emerging as an important model organism for neurobehavioral phenomics research. Given the likely variation of zebrafish behavioral phenotypes between and within laboratories, in this study, we examine the influence and variability of several common environmental modifiers on adult zebrafish anxiety and locomotor activity. Utilizing the novel tank paradigm, this study assessed the role of various laboratory factors, including experimenter/handling, testing time and days, batch, and the order of testing, on the behavior of a large population of experimentally naive control fish. Although time of the day, experimenter identity, and order of testing had little effect on zebrafish anxiety and locomotor activity levels, subtle differences were found for testing days and batches. Our study establishes how zebrafish behaviors are modulated by common environmental/laboratory factors and outlines several implications for zebrafish neurobehavioral phenomics research. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.

By combining video tracking and computer-controlled visual cue presentations on a liquid crystal display screen under the tank, we have developed a new method by which zebrafish can be trained to avoid one arm of a Y-shaped tank by presenting a specific color on the floor paired with an electric shock. Within two hours, zebrafish learn to choose the correct arm at an efficiency of 89.0%.

AB  - Ketamine inappropriate use has been associated with serious consequences for human health. Anesthetic properties of ketamine are well-known, but its side effects are poorly described, including the effects on anxiety. In this context, animal models are a safe way to conduct this neurobehavioral research and zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an interesting model which has several advantages. The validation and interpretation of results of behavioral assays requires a suitable statistical approach, and the use of multivariate statistical methods has been little explored, especially in zebrafish behavioral models. Here, we investigated the anxiolytic-induced effects of ketamine in adult zebrafish, using Light-Dark Test and proposing the Multivariate Statistics methods (PCA, HCA and SIMCA) to analyze the results. In addition, we compared the processing of data to the one carried out by analysis of variance (ANOVA) ketamine produced significant concentration of exposure-dependent anxiolytic effects, increasing time in white area and number of crossings and decreasing latency to first access to white area. Average entry duration behavior resulted in a slight decrease from control to treatment groups, with an observed concentration-dependent increase among the exposed groups. PCA results indicated that two principal components represent 88.74% of all the system information. HCA and PCA results showed a higher similarity among control and treatment groups exposed to lower concentrations of ketamine and among treatment groups exposed to concentrations of 40 and 60mgL-1. In SIMCA results, interclasses distances were concentration of exposure-dependent increased and misclassifications and interclasses residues results also support these findings. These findings confirm the anxiolytic potential of ketamine and zebrafish sensibility to this drug. In summary, our study confirms that zebrafish and multivariate statistics data validation are an appropriate and viable behavioral model for the study of psychoactive substances, providing a detailed and reliable analysis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The efficacy of anaesthetic tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222) was evaluated in four freshwater aquarium fish species, Zebrafish (Danio rerio), Guppy (Poecilia reticulata), Discu (Symphysodon discus) and Green swordtail (Xiphophorus helleri). The correct dose of anaesthetic should induce the plane 4 of anaesthesia in less than 180 s, recovery in less than 300 s and must survive when exposed during 30 min to anaesthetic. Fishes were exposed to six concentrations of anaesthetic (75, 100, 125, 150, 200 and 250 mg L-1) and the time of fish reaching plane 4 of anaesthesia, post exposure recovery, and the percentage of survival when fish were subject to 30 min in the anaesthetic were recorded. The optimal doses varied according to the species: D. rerio - 75, 100 and 125 mg L-1, P. reticulata - 125, 150 and 200 mg L-1, S. discus - 75 and 100 mg L-1 and X. helleri - 125 and 150 mg L-1. The induction time generally decreased significantly with increasing concentration of MS-222 for all of the species evaluated. The recovery time had a tendency to increase with the increase of the MS-222 concentration for D. rerio, P. reticulata and S. discus. On the other hand, X. helleri recovery time decreased with the increase of MS-222 concentration. MS-222 proved to be effective in anaesthesia for all the freshwater ornamental species studied. The main results clearly show that the optimal dose to anesthetize is fish species dependent and it is completely wrong to extrapolate optimal anaesthetic concentrations between different species. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Rationale: The zebrafish dopaminergic system is thought to be evolutionarily conserved and may be amenable to pharmacological manipulation using drugs developed for mammalian receptors. However, only few studies have examined the role of specific receptor subtypes in behaviour of adult zebrafish. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to determine the translational relevance of the zebrafish and examine the psychopharmacology of specific dopamine receptors in this species. Methods: Using a behavioural pharmacological approach, we examine the effect of D1 and D2/3 receptor antagonisms on motor patterns of adult zebrafish during acute drug exposure and withdrawal. Results: Acute exposure to SCH-23390 (D1 receptor antagonist) decreased total distance travelled in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure to amisulpride (D2/3 receptor antagonist) induced a biphasic dose-response in total distance travelled and in angular velocity. The results provide support for the existence of structurally and functionally conserved postsynaptic D1 and D2 receptors, as well as presynaptic D2 autoreceptors in the zebrafish brain. The behavioural effects of the employed antagonists did not persist following 30 min of withdrawal. Conclusion: The results suggest that zebrafish, a cheaper and simpler model organism compared to the rat and the mouse, may be an efficient translationally relevant tool for the analysis of the psychopharmacology of receptors of the vertebrate dopaminergic system. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Aggression is an important adaptive behavior that can be used to monopolize resources such as mates or food, acquire and defend territory and establish dominant hierarchies in social groups. It is also a symptom of several psychiatric disorders including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia. The frequent comorbidity of aggression and psychiatric diseases suggests that common genes and neural circuits may link these disorders. Research using animal models has the potential to uncover these genes and neural circuits despite the difficulty of fully modeling human behavioral disorders. In this review we propose that zebrafish may be a suitable model organism for aggression research with the potential to shed light upon the aggressive symptoms of human diseases. © 2014 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Rationale: Yohimbine demonstrated both anxiogenic and anxiolytic properties under different conditions in rodents. Few studies were conducted on zebrafish, a newly emerged vertebrate model organism. Zebrafish larvae are particularly suitable for high-throughput screening of drug effects. Objectives: The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of yohimbine on the anxiety-related behaviors of zebrafish larvae. Methods: AB strain zebrafish larvae at both 5 and 7 days postfertilization (dpf) were treated with different concentrations of yohimbine. General locomotor activities and thigmotaxis behavior were analyzed under continuous illumination, which represented normal condition, or under alternating light-dark challenges, which represented stressful environment. Results: Under continuous illumination, the 5-dpf larvae demonstrated increased swimming distances at low yohimbine concentrations, whereas the 7-dpf larvae demonstrated progressively decreased swimming distances with increases in yohimbine concentration. Low concentrations of yohimbine reduced thigmotaxis of the larvae, while high concentrations of yohimbine increased it. During the dark period of the lightdark challenge phase, low concentrations of yohimbine increased swimming distances of the larvae at both 5 and 7 dpf, while high concentrations of yohimbine decreased it. Yohimbine induced increased thigmotaxis in both 5- and 7-dpf larvae during the dark period. Conclusions: Under normal condition (lights on), low doses of yohimbine were anxiolytic in both the 5- and 7-dpf larvae, whereas high doses of yohimbine were anxiogenic only in the 7-dpf larvae. Under mildly stressful condition (lights off), yohimbine treatment demonstrated dose-dependent effects to potentiate anxiety-related behaviors in both the 5- and 7-dpf larvae, although the significant dose varied with age. © Springer-Verlag 2014.

AB  - Exposure to moderate levels of ethanol during brain development has a number of effects on social behavior but the molecular mechanisms that mediate this are not well understood. Gaining a better understanding of these factors may help to develop therapeutic interventions in the future. Zebrafish offer a potentially useful model in this regard. Here, we introduce a zebrafish model of moderate prenatal ethanol exposure. Embryos were exposed to 20mM ethanol for seven days (48hpf-9dpf) and tested as adults for individual social behavior and shoaling. We also tested their basal anxiety with the novel tank diving test. We found that the ethanol-exposed fish displayed reductions in social approach and shoaling, and an increase in anxiety in the novel tank test. These behavioral differences corresponded to differences in hrt1aa, slc6a4 and oxtr expression. Namely, acute ethanol caused a spike in oxtr and ht1aa mRNA expression, which was followed by down-regulation at 7dpf, and an up-regulation in slc6a4 at 72hpf. This study confirms the utility of zebrafish as a model system for studying the molecular basis of developmental ethanol exposure. Furthermore, it proposes a putative developmental mechanism characterized by ethanol-induced OT inhibition leading to suppression of 5-HT and up-regulation of 5-HT1A, which leads, in turn, to possible homeostatic up-regulation of 5-HTT at 72hpf and subsequent imbalance of the 5-HT system. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Addiction and substance abuse are found ubiquitously throughout human society. In the United States, these disorders are responsible for amassing hundreds of billions of dollars in annual costs associated with healthcare, crime and lost productivity. Efficacious treatments remain few in number, the development of which will be facilitated by comprehension of environmental, genetic, pharmacological and neurobiological mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of addiction. Animal models such as the zebrafish (Danio rerio) have gained momentum within various domains of translational research, and as a model of complex brain disorders (e.g., drug abuse). Behavioral quantification within the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm serves as a measure of the rewarding qualities of a given substance. If the animal develops an increase in preference for the drug paired environment, it is inferred that the drug has positive-reinforcing properties. This paper discusses the utility of the zebrafish model in conjunction with the CPP paradigm and reports CPP behavior following acute exposure to 0.0%, 0.25%, 0.50%, and 1.00% alcohol, and 0. mg/L, 50. mg/L, 100. mg/L and 150. mg/L caffeine. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and is caused by a loss of function of the fragile X mental retardation (fmr1) gene. Animal fmr1-knockout (KO) models are not only of interest for the study of FXS, but have also important implications for our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here we report the behavioral changes in fmr1-knockout zebrafish in an open field with two white and two transparent walls. The neophobic responses that in wild-type (WT) zebrafish normally occur during the first 5-10 min in an unfamiliar environment (such as freezing, hypo-activity and preferences for the bottom and opaque walls of the tank), were weakened in fmr1 mutants, suggesting a reduction of novelty-induced anxiety. The fmr1-KO zebrafish showed somewhat increased vertical activity beyond the 'neophobic phase', but no overall hyperactivity. The mutants demonstrated a clear habituation-independent preference for the transparent walls. Whether this was attributable to altered spatial information processing or to reduced avoidance of open spaces is discussed. Finally, since restrictive repetitive (or stereotypical) behaviors are frequently present in FXS and ASD patients, we analyzed relative turning angles, directional and preferential turning ratios and performed frequency-domain analysis. However, no indications of abnormal movement patterning were detected. The possible reasons for the absence of stereotypical behaviors are discussed in terms of behavioral endpoint selection and of eliciting conditions. Overall, our findings are consistent with those reported in fmr1-KO mice and suggest that further analysis of the fmr1-KO zebrafish model has potential to deepen our understanding of FXS and ASD. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In addition to vision, light information is used to regulate a range of animal physiology. Such nonimage-forming functions of light are mediated by nonvisual photoreceptors expressed in distinct neurons in the retina and the brain in most vertebrates. A nonvisual photoreceptor vertebrate ancient long opsin (VAL-opsin) possesses two functional isoforms in the zebrafish, encoded by valopa and valopb, which has received little attention. To delineate the neurochemical identities of valop cells and to test for colocalization of the valop isoforms, we used in situ hybridization to characterize the expression of the valop genes along with that of neurotransmitters and a neuropeptide known to be present at the sites of valop expression. Double labeling showed that the thalamic valop population coexpresses valopa and valopb. All the thalamic valop cells overlapped with a GABAergic cell mass that continues from the anterior nucleus to the intercalated thalamic nucleus. A novel valopa cell population found in the superior raphe was serotonergic in nature. A valopb cell population in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus was identified as containing thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Valopb cells localized in the hindbrain intermediate reticular formation were noncholinergic in nature (nonmotorneurons). Thus, the presence of valop cell populations in different brain regions with coexpression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides and the colocalization of valop isoforms in the thalamic cell population indicate regulatory and functional complexity of VAL-opsin in the brain of the zebrafish. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The existence of animal personality is well-established across a wide range of species, with the majority of evidence for this being obtained from individuals held in captivity. However, there has been little work assessing the influence of commonly-measured personality traits on fitness, which is pertinent when the genetic basis of personality is considered. We measured whether the reproductive behaviour and success of zebra finches in a captive mixed-sex aviary environment was influenced by an aspect of their personality, their exploratory behaviour in a single-sex social aviary. We found that more exploratory males made a greater number of breeding attempts and raised more nestlings than less exploratory males. These results were not confounded by extra-pair paternity, which was not related to personality, or by the individuals that did not initiate any reproductive attempts at all. Our work provides evidence that attributes of personality may influence the degree to which individuals cope with, and thrive in a captive environment and this should be accounted for in both experimental design and the interpretation of results. Furthermore, this suggests that there may be selection on these traits as part of the domestication process. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Vertebrate model organisms have been utilized in high throughput screening but only with substantial cost and human capital investment. The zebrafish is a vertebrate model species that is a promising and cost effective candidate for efficient high throughput screening. Larval zebrafish have already been successfully employed in this regard (Lessman, 2011), but adult zebrafish also show great promise. High throughput screening requires the use of a large number of subjects and collection of substantial amount of data. Collection of data is only one of the demanding aspects of screening. However, in most screening approaches that involve behavioral data the main bottleneck that slows throughput is the time consuming aspect of analysis of the collected data. Some automated analytical tools do exist, but often they only work for one subject at a time, eliminating the possibility of fully utilizing zebrafish as a screening tool. This is a particularly important limitation for such complex phenotypes as social behavior. Testing multiple fish at a time can reveal complex social interactions but it may also allow the identification of outliers from a group of mutagenized or pharmacologically treated fish. Here, we describe a novel method using a custom software tool developed within our laboratory, which enables tracking multiple fish, in combination with a sophisticated analytical approach for summarizing and analyzing high resolution behavioral data. This paper focuses on the latter, the analytic tool, which we have developed using the R programming language and environment for statistical computing. We argue that combining sophisticated data collection methods with appropriate analytical tools will propel zebrafish into the future of neurobehavioral genetic research. © 2014 .

AB  - Individual differences (IDs) in behavior among nonhuman animals have been documented in a wide range of taxa. Although traditionally considered noise around an average, other potentially adaptive sources of phenotypic variation exist. IDs in behavior that are consistent across time and context are more recently recognized as expressions of underlying personality traits, which may even be heritable. Unfortunately, despite the rapid advances that have been made in animal personality research utilizing fish the last decade, a few have detailed the groundwork necessary to document consistency in behavior across time and context. This foundation is required, by definition, before one can draw conclusions about personality traits. Here, we examine whether IDs in behavior are consistent over time and across contexts and explore the construct validity of six commonly used behavioral assays for examining four personality traits: aggression, boldness, fear, and exploration. Thirty zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed twice each to a small open field, large open field, mirror, emergence, novel object, and predator response test. Results revealed consistency in most behavioral measures across both time and context. There was mixed evidence for the construct validity of these assays in capturing the targeted personality traits. © 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - A major hindrance for the development of psychiatric drugs is the prediction of how treatments can alter complex behaviors in assays which have good throughput and physiological complexity. Here we report the development of a medium-throughput screen for drugs which alter anxiety-like behavior in adult zebrafish. The observed phenotypes were clustered according to shared behavioral effects. This barcoding procedure revealed conserved functions of anxiolytic, anxiogenic and psychomotor stimulating drugs and predicted effects of poorly characterized compounds on anxiety. Moreover, anxiolytic drugs all decreased, while anxiogenic drugs increased, serotonin turnover. These results underscore the power of behavioral profiling in adult zebrafish as an approach which combines throughput and physiological complexity in the pharmacological dissection of complex behaviors.

AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been a widely used vertebrate animal model in developmental biology and behavioral neuroscience, but knowledge about some of its basic behaviors, for example, light/dark preference, is still controversial. Appropriate preference for light or dark environments can be crucial for an animal's survival, so we hypothesize that zebrafish may have its light/dark preference varied with the circadian clock. In this present work, we tested the hypothesis by recording the light/dark preference in a two-compartment tank continuously for over 60h. We found that the light avoidance of fish generally increases with time from morning (8:00am) to midnight (2:00am), and then decreases with time from midnight (2:00am) to morning (8:00am), exhibiting a clear circadian-like trend in the light/dark preference. As melatonin can mediate circadian clock output and promote sleep in zebrafish, by adding extra melatonin at around 9:00am on the third day, the mean proportion of time fish spent in the dark area was increased significantly. Our results demonstrate that the circadian clock plays a significant role in regulating the light/dark preference in zebrafish, which provides valuable insights into understanding the metabolism mechanism underlying the neurobehavior, and facilitate further studies related to the neurobiology of normal and pathological behavior. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.

AB  - The pros and cons of using anaesthesia when handling fish in connection with experiments are debated. A widely adopted practice is to wait thirty minutes after anaesthesia before behavioural observations are initiated, but information about immediate effects of a treatment is then lost. This is pertinent for responses to acute stressors, such as acid injection in the acetic acid pain test. However, omission of anaesthetics in order to obtain data on immediate responses will compromise the welfare of fish and contribute to experimental noise due to stress. We therefore tested the effect of tricaine methanesulfonate on the behaviour of zebrafish. We predicted that tricaine (MS 222) would decrease swimming velocity and that the control fish would show an increased level of anxiety- and stress-related behaviours compared to the tricaine group. Following acclimatization to the test tank, baseline behaviour was recorded before immersion in either tricaine (168 mg l-1, treatment group, N = 8) or tank water (control group, N = 7). Latencies to lose equilibrium and to lose response to touch were registered. The fish was then returned to the test tank, and the latency to regain equilibrium was registered in anaesthetized fish. When equilibrium was regained, and at five, thirty and sixty minutes after the fish had been returned to the test tank, behaviour was recorded. The tricaine fish showed the following responses (mean ± sd): latency to lose equilibrium 22.6 s±3.9; latency to lose response to touch 101.9 s±26.8; latency to regain equilibrium 92.0 s±54.4. Contrary to our predictions, neither treatment caused a change in any of the behaviours registered. This indicates that tricaine has no effect on several commonly used behavioural parameters, and that it may be unnecessary to postpone behavioural observations to 30 min after anaesthesia. © 2014 Nordgreen et al.

AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly becoming a popular animal model for neurobehavioral and psychopharmacological research. While startle testing is a well-established assay to investigate anxiety-like behaviors in different species, screening of the startle response and its habituation in zebrafish is a new direction of translational biomedical research. This study focuses on a novel behavioral protocol to assess a tapping-induced startle response and its habituation in adult zebrafish that have been pharmacologically-induced to exhibit anxiety/depression-like behaviors. We demonstrated that zebrafish exhibit robust learning performance in a task adapted from the mammalian literature, a modified plus maze, and showed that ethanol and fluoxetine impair memory performance in this maze when administered after training at a dose that does not impair motor function, however, leads to significant upregulation of hippocampal serotoninergic neurons. These results suggest that the maze associative learning paradigm has face and construct validity and that zebrafish may become a translationally relevant study species for the analysis of the mechanisms of learning and memory changes associated with psychopharmacological treatment of anxiety/depression. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The use of psychotropic drugs in clinical and translational brain research continues to grow, and the need for novel experimental models and screens is becoming widely recognized. Mounting evidence supports the utility of zebrafish (Danio rerio) for studying various pharmacological manipulations, as an alternative model complementing the existing rodent paradigms in this field. Here, we explore the effects of acute 20-min exposure to two commonly abused psychotropic compounds, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and heroin, on adult zebrafish behavior in the novel tank test. Overall, THC administration (30 and 50 mg/L) produces an anxiogenic-like reduction of top swimming, paralleled with a slower, continuous bottom swimming. In contrast, heroin exposure (15 and 25 mg/L) evoked a hyperlocomotor response (with rapid bouts of bottom swimming and frequent 'bouncing' motions) without altering anxiety-sensitive top/bottom endpoints. The behavioral effects of these two compounds in zebrafish seem to parallel the respective rodent and human findings. Collectively, this emphasizes the growing significance of novel emerging aquatic models in translational drug abuse research and small molecule screening. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The behavior of fishes is very sensitive to the changes of the parameters of the environment, such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, light, and so on. The anomaly detection of fish school behavior can not only discover the relationship between the fish behaviors and the environmental parameters, but also provide an important method and tool for fish health monitoring and early warning. Moreover, it is very meaningful for the study of the mechanism of fish behavior and promotion of the informatization level in aquaculture. By using computer vision technology and based on a statistical method of motion features, the anomaly detection of fish school behavior was studied. The zebra fish was selected as the study object in this paper. First, based on the foreground object detection method with a threshold value method, the backgrounds were removed from the original video images to reduce the influence of noises. Secondly, by the Lucas-Kanade optical flow method, which is based on the local deference method and has better performance, the vectors of motion behavior could be obtained in different temporal and spatial conditions. Thirdly, from these data, the joint histograms and joint probability distributions of turning angles and velocities were calculated. Since from the practical point of view, the anomalous behaviors of a fish school mainly include the change of the moving velocity and the chaos of the moving direction. This is the reason to select turning angle and velocity as the features to analyze. At last, the NMI method and the LDOF methods were applied to study the anomaly detection of fish school behavior. By choosing proper threshold values, the NMI method and the LDOF methods can implement the behavior detection of the zebra fish school. The experiments showed that the accuracy rates of the NMI method and the LDOF method for anomaly detection of fish school behavior can achieve 99.92% and 99.88%, respectively, which implies that both of the two methods have better effects.

AB  - In the last 10 years, behavior assessment has been developed as an indicator of neurotoxicity and an integrated indicator of physiological disruption. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) release into the environment has increased in recent decades resulting in high concentrations of these compounds in the sediment of contaminated areas. We evaluated the behavioral consequences of long-term chronic exposure to PAHs, by exposing zebrafish to diets spiked with three PAH fractions at environmentally relevant concentrations. Fish were exposed to these chemicals from their first meal (5 days postfertilization) until they became reproducing adults (at 6 months old). The fractions used were representative of PAHs of pyrolytic (PY) origin and of two oils differing in composition (a heavy fuel oil (HO) and a light crude oil (LO)). Several tests were carried out to evaluate circadian spontaneous swimming activity, responses to a challenge (photomotor response), exploratory tendencies, and anxiety levels. We found that dietary PAH exposure was associated with greater mobility, lower levels of exploratory activity, and higher levels of anxiety, particularly in fish exposed to the HO fraction and, to a lesser extent, the LO fraction. Finally, our results indicate that PAH mixtures of different compositions, representative of situations encountered in the wild, can induce behavioral disruptions resulting in poorer fish performance. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Embryos of the zebrafish, Danio rerio, were exposed to a simulated geomagnetic storm during 24 hours. Fish, developed from these embryos, left a start chamber to an aquarium more readily in comparison to those reared in a normal geomagnetic field. On the other hand, general locomotor activity in fish was not essentially different between the two groups. We hypothesize that an exposure to a geomagnetic storm during embryonic period results in enhanced tolerance to stress caused by a novel environment. A low level stress is in turn a subject to further exploration.

AB  - Although the safety and efficacy of tricaine methanesulfonate (MS222) for anesthesia of fish are well established, other used less commonly in fish have been less extensively evaluated. Therefore, we compared gradual cooling, lidocaine hydrochloride (300, 325, and 350 mg/L), metomidate hydrochloride (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mg/L), and isoflurane (0.5 mL/L) MS222 (150 mg/L) for anesthesia of adult zebrafish. The efficacy and safety of each agent was evaluated by observing loss equilibrium, slowing of opercular movement, response to tail-fin pinch, recovery time, and anesthesia-associated mortality rates. At 15 min after anesthetic recovery, we used a novel-tank test to evaluate whether anesthetic exposure influenced term anxiety-like behavior. Behavioral parameters measured included latency to enter and number of transitions to the half of the tank, number of erratic movements, and number of freezing bouts. Behavior after anesthesia was unaltered of the anesthetic used. Efficacy and safety differed among the anesthetics evaluated. Gradual cooling was useful short procedures requiring immobilization only, but all instrumentation and surfaces that come in contact with fish must maintained at approximately 10°C. MS222 and lidocaine hydrochloride at 325 mg/L were effective as anesthetic agents for procedures in adult zebrafish, but isoflurane and high-dose lidocaine hydrochloride were unsuitable as sole anesthetic due to high (30%) mortality rates. Although MS222 remains the best choice for generating a surgical plane of anesthesia, metomidate hydrochloride and gradual cooling were useful for sedation and immobilization for nonpainful procedures.

AB  - Background and methods: We describe a method for obtaining pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacology data from adult zebrafish in terms of mg/kg using a novel method of oral administration. Using carbamazepine (CBZ) as a test drug, we employed dried blood spot (DBS) cards to enable drug quantification for PK; and we evaluated the pharmacological anxiolytic effect using novel tank test. Results: The PK study confirmed the presence of CBZ in both blood and brain and the behavioural study showed dose dependent anxiolytic effect. The reproducibility of oral dosing was confirmed by the fact that the results obtained in both the experiments had negligible errors. Conclusions: This report enables a novel approach for optimizing the utility of zebrafish in drug discovery and drug delivery research. © 2014 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

Fish that developed from these embryos came out of the starting enclosure into the aquarium sooner than those reared in the normal geomagnetic field. On the other hand, the two groups displayed no considerable difference in general locomotor activity. We hypothesize that exposure of embryos to a geomagnetic storm enhances tolerance to stress caused by a novel environment.

AB  - Alarm reactions to a substance secreted by the damaged skin of conspecifics and closely-related species are increasingly being recognized as fear-like responses in fish. The neurochemical underpinnings of these effects are so far unknown; however, given the role of the serotonergic system on defensive behavior, it is possible that the alarm reaction is mediated by this monoamine. Exposure to conspecific alarm substance (CAS) increased anxiety-like behavior in the light/dark test in zebrafish and decreased nocifensive behavior. These effects were accompanied by increases in blood glucose, hemoglobin, epinephrine and norepinephrine levels, as well as extracellular levels of serotonin in the brain. Pretreatment with fluoxetine blocked the anxiogenic effects of CAS on the light/dark test as well as all physiological parameters and the increase in extracellular brain 5-HT, but not the reduction in nocifensive behavior. Conversely, pretreatment with the 5-HT1AR antagonist WAY 100635 blocked the effects on nocifensive behavior, but not the effects on anxiety-like behavior nor on physiological parameters. These results point to an important and complex role of the serotonergic system in the mediation of fear-potentiated behavior in the light/dark test and in fear-induced analgesia in zebrafish. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Animal behaviour is the interaction between environment and an individual organism, which also can be influenced by its neighbours. Variations in environmental conditions, as those caused by contaminants, may lead to neurochemical impairments altering the pattern of the behavioural repertoire of the species. Atrazine (ATZ) is an herbicide widely used in agriculture that is frequently detected in surface water, affecting non-target species. The zebrafish is a valuable model organism to assess behavioural and neurochemical effects of different contaminants since it presents a robust behavioural repertoire and also all major neurotransmitter systems described for mammalian species. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of subchronic ATZ exposure in defensive behaviours of zebrafish (shoaling, thigmotaxis, and depth preference) using the split depth tank. Furthermore, to investigate a putative role of cholinergic signalling on ATZ-mediated effects, we tested whether this herbicide alters acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in brain and muscle preparations. Fish were exposed to ATZ for 14. days and the following groups were tested: control (0.2% acetone) and ATZ (10 and 1000. μg/L). The behaviour of four animals in the same tank was recorded for 6. min and biological samples were prepared. Our results showed that 1000. μg/L ATZ significantly increased the inter-fish distance, as well as the nearest and farthest neighbour distances. This group also presented an increase in the shoal area with decreased social interaction. No significant differences were detected for the number of animals in the shallow area, latency to enter the shallow and time spent in shallow and deep areas of the apparatus, but the ATZ 1000 group spent significantly more time near the walls. Although ATZ did not affect muscular AChE, it significantly reduced AChE activity in brain. Exposure to 10. μg/L ATZ did not affect behaviour or AChE activity. These data suggest that ATZ impairs defensive behaviours of zebrafish, which could be related to its action on brain cholinergic neurotransmission. Moreover, the use of the split depth tank could be an alternative strategy to assess group behaviour and depth preference after exposure to chemical compounds. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The zebrafish is a relatively new model organism and has become a valuable tool in genetic, developmental, and pharmacological researches. Zebrafish larvae, compared with adult, are particularly suitable for high-throughput screening of drug effects. AB and TU are well established in-bred zebrafish strains. The behavioral responses to acute MK-801 treatments (0, 5, 20, 100, and 200 μM) under illumination at 50 lx were studied using zebrafish larvae of both AB and TU strains at 7 dpf with ZebraLab software. Two behavioral parameters, traveling distance and activity counts,were analyzed. "Traveling distance" represents locomotor activity, whereas "activity count" is any activity including small, non-ambulatory movements. Zebrafish larvae of TU strain demonstrated inhibitory effects in both behavioral parameters in response to MK-801 treatment. Zebrafish larvae of AB strain showed lack of responses to MK-801 treatments in traveling distance, and showed increases in activity counts. Therefore, zebrafish larvae of AB and TU strains demonstrated opposite responses in activity counts towards MK-801 treatment. Differences in the level of neurotransmitters and their respective metabolites (NE and MHPG, DA and DOPAC, 5-HT and 5-HIAA) between AB and TU strain zebrafish larvae were discovered by HPLC analysis, which was related to the strain-dependent differential behavioral responses to MK-801 treatment. Conclusion: Under the influences of MK-801, in contrast with TU strain, AB strain zebrafish larvae demonstrated activity changes similar to previous studies on rodents. AB strain larvae are better model organisms than TU strain larvae in MK-801 related behavioral studies. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Like many aquatic animals, zebrafish (Danio rerio) moves in a 3D space. It is thus preferable to use a 3D recording system to study its behavior. The presented automatic video tracking system accomplishes this by using a mirror system and a calibration procedure that corrects for the considerable error introduced by the transition of light from water to air. With this system it is possible to record both single and groups of adult zebrafish. Before use, the system has to be calibrated. The system consists of three modules: Recording, Path Reconstruction, and Data Processing. The step-by-step protocols for calibration and using the three modules are presented. Depending on the experimental setup, the system can be used for testing neophobia, white aversion, social cohesion, motor impairments, novel object exploration etc. It is especially promising as a first-step tool to study the effects of drugs or mutations on basic behavioral patterns. The system provides information about vertical and horizontal distribution of the zebrafish, about the xyz-components of kinematic parameters (such as locomotion, velocity, acceleration, and turning angle) and it provides the data necessary to calculate parameters for social cohesions when testing shoals.

AB  - Because of its highly developed social character, zebrafish is a promising model system for the study of the genetic and neurochemical basis of altered social engagement such as is common in autism and schizophrenia. The traditional shoaling paradigm investigates social cohesion in homogeneous groups of zebrafish. However, the social dynamics of mixed groups is gaining interest from a therapeutic point of view and thus warrants animal modeling. Furthermore, mutant zebrafish are not always available in large numbers. Therefore, we developed a new paradigm that allows exploring shoaling in heterogeneous groups. The effects of MK-801, a non-competitive antagonist of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, on social cohesion were studied to evaluate the paradigm. The drug has previously been shown to mimic aspects of autism and schizophrenia. Our results show that a single MK-801-treated zebrafish reduced social cohesion of the entire shoal drastically. Preliminary observations suggest that the social dynamics of the shoal as a whole was altered. © 2013 Maaswinkel et al.

AB  - The zebrafish has been proposed for the study of the effects of ethanol on the vertebrate brain. Behavioural tests have been successfully employed in the phenotypical characterization of these effects. However, the short scale (minute to minute) time course of ethanol induced changes of zebrafish behaviour has not been analyzed. The current study alleviates this need using a 2. ×. 3 chronic. ×. acute ethanol exposure experimental design. We first expose zebrafish to ethanol chronically using a dose escalation procedure in which fish are kept in a final concentration of 0.5% vol/vol ethanol for 10 days while control fish receive identical dosing procedures but no ethanol. Subsequently, we expose zebrafish for 1. h to an acute dose of ethanol (0.00, 0.50, or 1.00% vol/vol) and monitor their behaviour throughout this period. We quantify the mean and within-individual temporal variance of distance travelled, distance from bottom and angular velocity using video-tracking, and establish temporal trajectories of ethanol induced behavioural changes in zebrafish. For example, we find fish of the highest acute dose group previously not exposed to chronic ethanol to exhibit an inverted U shaped temporal trajectory in distance travelled (biphasic alcohol effect). We find this response to be blunted after chronic ethanol exposure (development of tolerance). We also describe an acute ethanol withdrawal induced increase in angular velocity. We conclude that temporal analysis of zebrafish behaviour is a sensitive method for the study of chronic and acute ethanol exposure induced functional changes in the vertebrate brain. © 2013 .

AB  - Wild-type (WT) zebrafish are commonly used in behavioral tests, but the term WT is not a precise description, and corresponds to many different strains (e.g., AB, TU, WIK, and others). Previous studies compared the physiological, behavioral, or metabolic characteristics of different zebrafish strains (indigenous WT populations versus laboratory WT strains). AB and TU are widely used, but at least one study has demonstrated behavioral differences between them. To choose the most appropriate strain for our experiments, we systematically screened behavioral responses of AB and TU fish in several assays. We analyzed the locomotion activity and responses to a light/dark challenge in adults and larvae, and exploratory behavior and color conditioning in adults. Differences were observed for all tests, the strains displaying particular behavior depending on the tests. As larvae, TU displayed a wider activity range than AB larvae at the onset of locomotor behavior; as adults, TU were more reactive to sudden light transitions and recovered the swimming activity faster in T-maze or homebase release in novel tank tests, whereas AB fish had more contrasted circadian rhythms and performed better in color learning. Strain-specific behavior should be considered when designing experiments using behavior. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - The use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has been banned for several decades. PCBs have a long biological half-life and high liposolubility which leads to their bioaccumulation and biomagnification through food chains over a wide range of trophic levels. Exposure can lead to changes in animal physiology and behavior and has been demonstrated in both experimental and field analyses. There are also potential risks to high trophic level predators, including humans. A maternal transfer has been demonstrated in fish as PCBs bind to lipids in eggs. In this study, behavioral traits (exploration and free swimming, with or without challenges) of contaminated zebrafish (Danio rerio) adults and their offspring (both as five-day-old larvae and as two-month-old fish reared under standard conditions) were measured using video-tracking. Long-term dietary exposure to a mixture of non-coplanar PCBs was used to mimic known environmental contamination levels and congener composition. Eight-week-old fish were exposed for eight months at 26-28°C. Those exposed to an intermediate dose (equivalent to that found in the Loire Estuary, ∑CB=515ngg-1 dry weight in food) displayed behavioral disruption in exploration capacities. Fish exposed to the highest dose (equivalent to that found in the Seine Estuary, ∑CB=2302ngg-1 dry weight in food) displayed an increased swimming activity at the end of the night. In offspring, larval activity was increased and two-month-old fish occupied the bottom section of the tank less often. These findings call for more long-term experiments using the zebrafish model; the mechanisms underlying behavioral disruptions need to be understood due to their implications for both human health and their ecological relevance in terms of individual fitness and survival. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Zebrafish has been increasingly used in behavioral studies, but data can present high variability. Most studies have been performed using isolated zebrafish, despite their interactive nature and shoaling behavior. We compared adult zebrafish behavior and cortisol levels after exposure to novelty as well as sensitivity to Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in animals tested individually or in groups of three (triplets). In the exploratory behavior task, data from single fish and triplets were not significantly different, but single fish data were more disperse in latency, to enter and time spent in the tank upper part, and crossings. In the light-dark task, time in the light zone and crossings were not different between groups, but latency to enter the dark zone and data variability were. We also observed that the latency to reach stage III seizures induced by PTZ was higher in triplets, but data dispersion was not different from single fish. Finally, cortisol levels of fish individually exposed to a novel environment were higher and more variable than triplets, while both groups had higher levels than unmanipulated animals. Thus, when tested individually, zebrafish are more stressed and present more variable behavior due to disruption of their natural shoal strategies. These features can be beneficial or detrimental depending on study aims and should be considered when designing, analyzing, and interpreting zebrafish behavioral data. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Lead (Pb2+) affects neuronal and endocrine systems that influence social interactions. By providing potential hiding locations, spatial heterogeneity may affect Pb2+-induced behavioral outcomes. Therefore, a test chamber was designed into which a refuge could be inserted. The refuge allowed test subjects to escape from the mirror image that stimulated agonistic interactions. Behaviors with a mirror were compared with baseline activity patterns without a mirror. Adult (12-month old) male and female zebrafish, exposed to Pb2+ (0-10 μM) as embryos (2-24 hours post fertilization), were tested individually for 5 min in each chamber design within 2 h of feeding. Behaviors were evaluated for % time in mirror zone, distance traveled (=activity level), and attacks on the mirror image. When there was no refuge, significant concentration-dependent increases occurred in male % time in mirror zone, activity level, and number of attacks. Increases in these variables were less pronounced in females. When there was a refuge, there were significant differences for males only in activity level and attacks at the higher developmental exposure concentrations; % time in mirror zone followed a similar pattern and level as without refuge. Females displayed Pb 2+-induced behavioral changes only for attacks on mirror. Since the presence of refuges that is, environmental enrichment, reduced Pb 2+-induced agonistic behavior in both sexes, experimental spatial design can be considered an important factor when interpreting behavioral outcomes. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Cannabinoids are natural or synthetic compounds related chemically to (-)-(6aR,10aR)-6,6,9-trimethyl-3-pentyl-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6H-benzo[c] chromen-1-ol (Δ9-THC), the principle psychotropic constituent of the hemp plant, Cannabis sativa L. Here we examine the effects of the cannabinoids Δ9-THC, (R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4- morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo [1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-napthalenylmethanone and 2-[(1R,2R,5R)-5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxypropyl) cyclohexyl]-5-(2-methyloctan-2- yl)phenol, and the cannabinoid antagonist (AM 251). Exposures were either acute (1-12-h exposure at 108 hours of postfertilization [hpf]) or chronic (96-h exposure starting at 24 hpf). Geometric range finding was used to determine the experimental concentrations. The concentration of the chemical that kills 50% of the test animals in a given time (LC50) was determined based on cumulative mortality at 5 days of postfertilization. At day 5, behavioral analysis (visual motor response test) was carried out in which movement of individual larvae was analysed using automated video-tracking. With acute exposure, embryos showed a biphasic response to the dark challenge with all three cannabinoids tested. This response consisted of stimulation of the locomotor activity at low concentrations, suppression at high doses. With chronic exposure, embryos habituated to the effects of all three cannabinoids when assayed with the dark challenge phase. Further, the excitation was ameliorated when the antagonist AM 251 was coadministered with the cannabinoid. When AM 251 was administered on its own (chronically or acutely), the locomotor activity was suppressed at high concentrations. We examined the embryos for a range of malformations after chronic exposure to cannabinoid. Only Δ9-THC was associated with a significant increase in malformations at 5d (yolk sac and pericardial edema, bent tail/body axis). We conclude that cannabinoids have behavioral effects in zebrafish that are comparable to some of those reported in the literature for mammals. In particular, the acute exposure response resembles behavioral effects reported for adult rodents. Our data are consistent with these behavioral effects being mediated, at least in part, by the CB1 receptor. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Brain monoamines play a key role in the regulation of behavior. Reserpine depletes monoamines, and causes depression and hypoactivity in humans and rodents. In contrast, d-amphetamine increases brain monoamines' levels, and evokes hyperactivity and anxiety. However, the effects of these agents on behavior and in relation to monoamine levels remain poorly understood, necessitating further experimental studies to understand their psychotropic action. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly emerging as a promising model organism for drug screening and translational neuroscience research. Here, we have examined the acute and long-term effects of reserpine and d-amphetamine on zebrafish behavior in the novel tank test. Overall, d-amphetamine (5 and 10 mg/L) evokes anxiogenic-like effects in zebrafish acutely, but not 7 days later. In contrast, reserpine (20 and 40 mg/L) did not evoke overt acute behavioral effects, but markedly reduced activity 7 days later, resembling motor retardation observed in depression and/or Parkinson's disease. Three-dimensional 'temporal' (X, Y, time) reconstructions of zebrafish locomotion further supports these findings, confirming the utility of 3D-based video-tracking analyses in zebrafish models of drug action. Our results show that zebrafish are highly sensitive to drugs bi-directionally modulating brain monoamines, generally paralleling rodent and clinical findings. Collectively, this emphasizes the potential of zebrafish tests to model complex brain disorders associated with monoamine dysregulation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Serotonin (5-HT) is a neurotransmitter that is involved in many behavioral functions, including the organization of defense, and its putative pathological correlate, anxiety and stress disorders. Recently, behavioral tests for anxiety have been proposed in zebrafish. Exposure to the novel tank test or to the light/dark test increased extracellular fluid 5-HT content in the brain; anxiety-like behavior correlated positively with 5-HT content in the novel tank test, while the correlation was negative in the light/dark test. Acute treatment with a low dose of fluoxetine was anxiolytic in the geotaxis test and anxiogenic in the scototaxis test, while treatment with a higher dose produced a hyperlocomotor effect in both tasks. Buspirone and WAY 100635 were anxiolytic in both tests, while SB 224289 was anxiolytic in the geotaxis and slightly anxiogenic in the scototaxis test. Serotonin depletion with pCPA was anxiogenic in the geotaxis and anxiolytic in scototaxis. These results underline the differential sensitivity of these tasks to assess serotonergic agents; alternatively, serotonin might regulate zebrafish behavior differently in the novel tank test and in the light/dark test. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Zebrafish are gaining momentum as a laboratory animal species for the study of anxiety-related disorders in translational research, whereby they serve a fundamental complement to laboratory rodents. Several anxiety-related behavioral paradigms, which rest upon the presentation of live predatorial stimuli, may yield inconsistent results due to fatigue, habituation, or idiosyncratic responses exhibited by the stimulus itself. To overcome these limitations, we designed and manufactured a fully controllable robot inspired by a natural aquatic predator (Indian leaf fish, Nandus nandus) of zebrafish. We report that this robot elicits aversive antipredatorial reactions in a preference test and that data obtained therein correlate with data observed in traditional anxiety- and fear-related tests (light/dark preference and shelter-seeking). Finally, ethanol administration (0.25; 0.50; 1.00%) exerts anxiolytic effects, thus supporting the view that robotic stimuli can be used in the analysis of anxiety-related behaviors in zebrafish. © 2013 Cianca et al.

AB  - Abnormal social behavior is a hallmark of several human neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders for which appropriate treatment is lacking. The zebrafish has been proposed as a tool with which these disorders may be modeled and their mechanisms analyzed. A potential starting point of such analyses is the identification of genetic differences between distinct zebrafish strains. Here we compare AB and TU, two well established zebrafish strains, and characterize the developmental trajectories of their shoaling (social) behavior and of the levels of dopamine, serotonin as well as a metabolite of each of these neurotransmitters, DOPAC and 5HIAA from whole brain extracts. Using a novel video-tracking software application, we demonstrate significant strain dependent changes in the maturation of shoaling between day 7 and day 87 post-fertilization. Using high-precision liquid chromatography specifically adapted to zebrafish, we uncover a significant age. ×. strain interaction in dopamine and DOPAC that apparently correlates well with the behavioral differences found between the strains. We also report on strain differences in serotonin and 5HIAA. We discuss possible mechanistic analyses that will address causality and conclude that zebrafish will be a useful tool with which the neurobiological and genetic bases of social behavior may be analyzed in vertebrates. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding the different patterns of anxiety-like behavioral responses is of great interest for pharmacological and genetic research. Here we report the effects of 3.5-hr habituation, buspirone and ethanol on those responses in shoaling zebrafish (Danio rerio). Since in these experiments we used a container with white walls, the effects of black-vs.-white walls were tested in a separate experiment. An important objective was to determine whether factors unrelated to anxiety played a role in modulating the responses. The anxiety-like behavioral responses studied here are social cohesion, distance from bottom and bottom-dwell time, radial distribution (to study thigmotaxis), transparent-wall preference (to study escape responses), locomotion and freezing. The experimental conditions yielded distinctly different response patterns. Thigmotaxis was the most obvious response to white walls and it was significantly reduced after 3.5-hr habituation. It was not affected by any of the drugs. The reduction of social cohesion after 3.5-hr habituation and in the 0.5% ethanol group was probably the most interesting effect seen in this study. A role of anxiety herein was suggested but could not be established with certainty. Other hypotheses were also discussed. The large increase of distance-from-bottom resulting in swimming close to the water surface, which occurred in both buspirone groups and in the 0.5%-ethanol group, is most likely not an anxiolytic response, because of the discrepancy with the in the literature well-established time-course and the absence of any effect of 3.5-hr habituation or black walls on vertical measures. Finally, locomotion and duration freezing could not be specifically taken as indicators for the state of anxiety and the results concerning transparent-wall preference were not sufficient clear. We conclude that the neuronal and ethological mechanisms underlying the effects of habituation, white-aversion, buspirone and ethanol on anxiety-like behavioral responses are complex and need further exploration. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Anxiety and depression are major chronic mood disorders, and the etiopathology for each appears to be repeated exposure to diverse unpredictable stress factors. Most of the studies on anxiety and related mood disorders are performed in rodents, and a good model is chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). In this study, we have attempted to understand the molecular basis of the neuroglial and behavioral changes underlying CUS-induced mood disorders in the simplest vertebrate model, the zebrafish, Danio rerio. Zebrafish were subjected to a CUS paradigm in which two different stressors were used daily for 15 days, and thorough behavioral analyses were performed to assess anxiety and related mood disorder phenotypes using the novel tank test, shoal cohesion and scototaxis. Fifteen days of exposure to chronic stressors appears to induce an anxiety and related mood disorder phenotype. Decreased neurogenesis, another hallmark of anxiety and related disorders in rodents, was also observed in this zebrafish model. The common molecular markers of rodent anxiety and related disorders, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), calcineurin (ppp3r1a) and phospho cyclic AMP response element binding protein (pCREB), were also replicated in the fish model. Finally, using 2DE FTMS/ITMSMS proteomics analyses, 18 proteins were found to be deregulated in zebrafish anxiety and related disorders. The most affected process was mitochondrial function, 4 of the 18 differentially regulated proteins were mitochondrial proteins: PHB2, SLC25A5, VDAC3 and IDH2, as reported in rodent and clinical samples. Thus, the zebrafish CUS model and proteomics can facilitate not only uncovering new molecular targets of anxiety and related mood disorders but also the routine screening of compounds for drug development. © 2013 Chakravarty et al.

AB  - Alcohol abuse can lead to severe psychological and physiological damage. Little is known, however, about the relative impact of a small, daily dose of alcohol (daily-moderate schedule) versus a large, once per week dose (weekly-binge schedule). In this study, we examined the effect of each of these schedules on behavioural measures of anxiety in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Adult wild-type zebrafish were administered either 0.2% ethanol on a daily-moderate schedule or 1.4% ethanol on a weekly-binge schedule for a period of 21 days, and then tested for scototaxis (preference for darkness) during withdrawal. Compared to a control group with no alcohol exposure, the daily-moderate group spent significantly more time on the light side of the arena (indicative of decreased anxiety) on day two of withdrawal, but not day 9 of withdrawal. The weekly-binge group was not significantly different from the control group on either day of withdrawal and showed no preference for either the light or dark zones. Our results indicate that even a small dose of alcohol on a daily basis can cause significant, though reversible, changes in behaviour. © 2013 Holcombe et al.

AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are emerging as a promising model organism for experimental studies relevant to biological psychiatry. The objective of this study was to develop a novel video-based movement tracking and analysis system to quantify behavioral changes following psychoactive drug exposure in zebrafish. We assessed the effects of withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure, and subsequent administration of fluoxetine (Prozac®), buspirone (Buspar®), and diazepam (Valium) using two behavioral paradigms; the Novel Tank Diving Test and the Light/Dark Choice Assay. A video tracking system was developed using two Apple® applications (Apps) to quantify these behaviors. Data from zebrafish exposed to the above treatments are presented in this paper not only to exemplify behavioral alterations associated with chronic exposure, but also more importantly, to validate the video tracking system. Following withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure, zebrafish exhibited dose/time-dependent anxiogenic effects; including reduced exploration and freezing behavior in the Novel Tank Diving Test, and preference for the dark area for the Light/Dark Choice Assay. In contrast, the above drug treatments had significant anxiolytic effects. We have developed a simple and cost-effective method of measuring zebrafish behavioral responses. The iPhone® Apps outlined in this study offer numerous flexible methods of data acquisition; namely, ease of identification and tracking of multiple animals, tools for visualization of the tracks, and calculation of a range of analysis parameters. Furthermore, the limited amount of time required for interpretation of the video data makes this a powerful high-throughput tool with potential applications for pre-clinical drug development. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The zebrafish has been used in the analysis of the effects of drugs of abuse, including alcohol and nicotine. In the current study, we investigate the effects of these drugs on shoaling, group-forming behavior, in zebrafish, using a newly developed set of behavioral measures. We expose our fish acutely to 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 or 1.00% (% v/v) ethyl alcohol or 4 or 8. mg/L nicotine by immersing the fish in the corresponding solutions. The behavior of the exposed fish is compared to controls in a large (91. cm diameter) circular tank in which shoals of 8 subjects under the same treatment are allowed to swim freely. Several measures of shoaling are quantified including the nearest neighbour distance (NND), inter-individual distance (IID), swimming speed, polarization (a measure of the directional synchronization of the shoal), and the number and duration of excursions (departures from the shoal). Alcohol and nicotine were both found to exert significant effects on shoaling but impaired the behavior in different ways. For example, alcohol strongly disrupted polarization and only modestly reduced shoal cohesion, while nicotine had only a modest effect on polarization but robustly decreased shoal cohesion. Neither drug affected the number or the duration of excursions, but both reduced swimming speed. These results underscore the notion that using multiple measures of social behavior may allow one to characterize and distinguish different aspects of drug effects on behavior, which may facilitate discovery of novel drugs in drug screens and may also be utilized in the analysis of underlying mechanisms. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) is a common convulsant agent used in animal models to investigate the mechanisms of seizures. Although adult zebrafish have been recently used to study epileptic seizures, a thorough characterization of the PTZ-induced seizures in this animal model is missing. The goal of this study was to perform a detailed temporal behavior profile characterization of PTZ-induced seizure in adult zebrafish. The behavioral profile during 20 min of PTZ immersion (5, 7.5, 10, and 15 mM) was characterized by stages defined as scores: (0) short swim, (1) increased swimming activity and high frequency of opercular movement, (2) erratic movements, (3) circular movements, (4) clonic seizure-like behavior, (5) fall to the bottom of the tank and tonic seizure-like behavior, (6) death. Animals exposed to distinct PTZ concentrations presented different seizure profiles, intensities and latencies to reach all scores. Only animals immersed into 15 mM PTZ showed an increased time to return to the normal behavior (score 0), after exposure. Total mortality rate at 10 and 15 mM were 33% and 50%, respectively. Considering all behavioral parameters, 5, 7.5, 10, and 15 mM PTZ, induced seizures with low, intermediate, and high severity, respectively. Pretreatment with diazepam (DZP) significantly attenuated seizure severity. Finally, the brain PTZ levels in adult zebrafish immersed into the chemoconvulsant solution at 5 and 10 mM were comparable to those described for the rodent model, with a peak after a 20-min of exposure. The PTZ brain levels observed after 2.5-min PTZ exposure and after 60-min removal from exposure were similar. Altogether, our results showed a detailed temporal behavioral characterization of a PTZ epileptic seizure model in adult zebrafish. These behavioral analyses and the simple method for PTZ quantification could be considered as important tools for future investigations and translational research. © 2013 Mussulini et al.

AB  - The early-life stress has critical impact on brain development which can lead to long-term effects on brain functions during adulthood. It has been reported that caffeine possesses a protective effect in neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, this study investigates the potential of caffeine to protect brain functions from adverse effects due to stress exposure during early-life development in the male zebrafish. In the first part of this study, synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (DEX) (2-200. mg/L for 24. h) was used to induce stress effects in the zebrafish larvae from 4 to 5. days post-fertilisation (dpf) and the effect of DEX administration on zebrafish larvae on anxiety-like behaviour during adulthood in novel tank test was investigated. Next, the possible protective effect of caffeine pre-treatment (5-50. mg/L for 24. h from 3 to 4. dpf) before DEX administration was studied. DEX-treated adult male zebrafish showed higher anxiety levels in behavioural tests, as seen in longer latency to enter the top part of the tank, lower transition numbers between the top and bottom parts with more time spent at the bottom and lesser time spent at the top and lower distance travelled at top part. The effect of DEX on anxiety-like behaviour was dose-dependent. Importantly, adult male zebrafish pre-treated with caffeine before DEX treatment did not show any anxiety-like behaviour. These results show that exposure to stress during early-life leads to anxiety-like behaviour in the adult male zebrafish but pre-treatment with caffeine protects from stress-induced anxiety. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Intra-session habituation to novelty reflects spatial working memory (related to exploration and cognition), and is observed in various species, including zebrafish (Danio rerio). With the growing understanding of complex zebrafish behaviors, the extent to which they habituate remains unclear. Here we perform a large-scale characterization of zebrafish novelty-evoked (novel tank and open field) behaviors, to establish their grouping based on intra-session habituation and sensitivity to anxiolytic or anxiogenic manipulations. We also assess multiple behaviors in high- and low-anxiety sub-cohorts of a large heterogeneous zebrafish population, comparing their habituation profiles. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that anxiety responsivity and the ability to habituate show little correlation for multiple zebrafish behaviors, suggesting that they most likely represent distinct behavioral phenomena in novel environments. Using these data, we also present the habituome - a new conceptual approach to study affective and cognitive responses in zebrafish by examining a big set of their habituation phenotypes. Given marked similarity in animal novelty exploration, this approach may also be used to construct habituomes in other model organisms, including rodents and humans. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We report the effect of orally administered gabapentin (GBP) on pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure-like activity in adult zebrafish. Zebrafish were pretreated with vehicle or GBP using a novel method of precise oral administration, followed by an intraperitoneal administration of PTZ. Behavioral assessment was carried out using locomotion-based video-tracking analysis and seizure score assignment using visual observation. Cephalic field potential recordings of the zebrafish brain were conducted using an electrical data acquisition system. Orally administered GBP significantly suppressed the seizure-like locomotor activity and strong slow-wave (~3Hz) activity in the cephalic field potential caused by PTZ. This work is the first report of the activity of an orally delivered anticonvulsant in adult zebrafish. Our study provides behavioral and physiological evidence in support of an adult zebrafish model for studying seizures including excitotoxic brain injury and a novel in vivo framework for the evaluation of pharmacological modulators of epilepsy.

AB  - To screen the learning and memory mutant from N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenic zebrafish F1, and to get the new model animal to study the mechanism of learning and memory. Zebrafish mutant was screened by inhibitory avoidance behavioral test and identified by the expression of gene c-fos with qRT-PCR. We isolated a zebrafish mutant related to learning and memory, fgt. In this fgt zebrafish mutant long-term memory was much lower than that in wild-type when tested at 24 h after training. The 24 h long-term memory in about half of fgt mutant F2 (13/30) were significantly lower than those in wild-type, and the others relatively normal. Compared with the expression in wild-type fishes, the expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs) c-fos in half of fgt mutant F2 (13/30) after exploring in a novel environment increased distinctly from the basal control levels statistically, and the others relatively normal, which were in accordance with the behavioral results. The zebrafish mutant fgt is a dominant mutant with defect in long-term memory.

AB  - Zebrafish provide a powerful model of the impacts of embryonic toxicant exposure on neural development that may result in long-term behavioral dysfunction. In this study, zebrafish embryos were treated with 1.5. mM strychnine for short embryonic time windows to induce transient changes in inhibitory neural signaling, and were subsequently raised in untreated water until adulthood. PCR analysis showed indications that strychnine exposure altered expression of some genes related to glycinergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neuronal synapses during embryonic development. In adulthood, treated fish showed significant changes in swimming speed and tank diving behavior compared to controls. Taken together, these data show that a short embryonic exposure to a neurotoxicant can alter development of neural synapses and lead to changes in adult behavior. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Behavioral changes in zebrafish induced by acute administration of buspirone have been interpreted to be the result of reduced anxiety. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether the effects of short-term and mid-term habituation to an open field corroborated the anxiolytic hypothesis. We exposed single zebrafish for 60. min to 5. mg. L buspirone and tested them twice, immediately after exposure and again 3.5. h later. Each session lasted 20. min. Distance from bottom of tank, velocity, duration freezing, distance from center and horizontal distribution, and preferred spatial location were analyzed with a 3-D tracking system. In the early session (starting at 10:30), 20. min habituation of control zebrafish only marginally increased distance from bottom, which was still 90% higher in zebrafish treated with buspirone. When extending the habituation to 3.5. h, the picture became more complex. Distance from bottom did not further increase in control zebrafish. More importantly, some signs of increased anxiety were present in the buspirone group, such as increased freezing, reduced velocity, and increased bottom-dwelling. However, analyzing data of individual fish excluded rebound anxiety as unlikely. The delayed effects might be drug side effects, such as motor impairment and/or dizziness. The immediate and the delayed effects of buspirone have the appearance to be unrelated. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly becoming an important model organism in neuroscience research, representing an excellent species to study complex social phenotypes. Zebrafish actively form shoals, which can be used to quantify their shoaling behaviors, highly sensitive to various experimental manipulations. Recent advances in video-tracking techniques have enabled simultaneous tracking of multiple subjects, previously assessed by manual scoring of animal behavior. Here we examined the effect of group-size in the shoaling paradigm (ranging from 2 to 8 fish), and evaluated the ability of novel video-tracking tools to accurately track an entire shoal, compared to traditional manual analysis of shoaling phenotypes. To further validate our approach, the effects of the psychotropic drugs lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and 3,4-methlenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), as well as exposure to alarm pheromone, previously shown to affect zebrafish shoaling, were examined. Overall, a significant difference in group size was shown in the 2-fish vs. the 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- and 8-fish groups. Moreover, both LSD and MDMA treatments reduced shoaling (assessed by increased inter-fish distance) as well as proximity (time spent together) among fish. In contrast, exposure to alarm pheromone yielded an increase in shoaling and in proximity in a time-dependent manner. Importantly, a highly significant correlation for manual vs. automated analyses was revealed across all experiments. Collectively, this study further supports the utility of zebrafish to study social behavior, also demonstrating the capacity of video-tracking technology to assess zebrafish shoaling in a high-throughput and reliable manner. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abnormal dopamine (DA) signaling is often suggested as causative in schizophrenia. The other prominent hypothesis for this disorder, largely driven by epidemiological data, is that certain adverse events during the early stages of brain development increase an individual's risk of developing schizophrenia later in life. However, the clinical and preclinical literature consistently implicates behavioural, cognitive, and pharmacological abnormalities, implying that DA signaling is abnormal in the adult brain. How can we reconcile these two major hypotheses underlying much of the clinical and basic research into schizophrenia? In this study we have transiently knocked down tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, the rate limiting enzyme in DA synthesis) gene expression in the early stages of brain development in zebrafish using morpholinos. We show that by adulthood, TH and DA levels have returned to normal and basic DA-mediated behaviours, such as locomotion, are also normal. However, when they were exposed to a novel environment the levels of freezing and immediate positioning in deeper zones were significantly reduced in these adult fish. The neurochemistry underlying these behaviours is complex, and the exact mechanisms for these abnormal behaviours remains unknown. This study demonstrates that early transient alterations in DA ontogeny can produce persistent alterations in adult brain function and suggests that the zebrafish may be a promising model animal for future studies directed at clarifying the basic neurodevelopmental mechanisms behind complex psychiatric disease. © 2012 Formella et al.

AB  - Several characteristics warrant the zebrafish a refining animal model for toxicity testing in rodents, thereby contributing to the 3R principles (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement) in animal testing, e.g. its small size, ease of obtaining a high number of progeny, external fertilization, transparency and rapid development of the embryo, and a basic understanding of its gene function and physiology. In this context we explored the motor activity pattern of zebrafish larvae, using a 96-well microtiter plate and a video-tracking system. Effects of induced light and darkness on locomotion of zebrafish larvae of different wild-type strains and ages (AB and TL, 5, 6 and 7 dpf; n = 25/group) were studied. Locomotion was also measured in zebrafish larvae after exposure to different concentrations of ethanol (0; 0.5; 1; 2 and 4%) (AB and TL strain, 6 dpf; n = 19/group). Zebrafish larvae showed a relatively high swimming activity in darkness when compared to the activity in light. Small differences were found between wild-type strains and/or age. Ethanol exposure resulted in hyperactivity (0.5-2%) and in hypo-activity (4%). In addition, the limitations and/or relevance of the parameters distance moved, duration of movements and velocity are exemplified and discussed. Together, the results support the suggestion that zebrafish may act as an animal refining alternative for toxicity testing in rodents provided internal and external environmental stimuli are controlled. As such, light, age and strain differences must be taken into account. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Enrichment of the environment for captive animals is aimed at producing beneficial effects on the behaviour and physiology of relevant species, and is commonly used to reduce harmful social behaviours and stereotypies. However, little work has been undertaken to develop enrichment strategies for fish, in particular those used in regulatory toxicology where strict criteria regarding holding conditions and experimental design can make implementing such techniques problematic. Here, we studied the effect of vertical rod structures, designed to increase environmental complexity and provide refuge, on several commonly cited anxiety-related behaviours and whole-body levels of the stress hormone cortisol in juvenile zebrafish measured over a 1-week period. Activity levels and shoaling density showed no response to tank structures and fish did not spend a significantly greater or lesser amount of time in areas of tanks containing glass rods. Aggression remained high during days 1-5 in tanks containing glass structures before falling to a lower level by day 7. In control tanks, this lower level was reached 2 days earlier, by day 5, suggesting that the glass structures may have slowed the rate of establishment of dominant/subordinate relationships. Overall, whole-body cortisol levels of fish were comparable to those reported in unstressed zebrafish in other studies. Levels were significantly higher in both treatments after 24. h than on subsequent days, most likely due to the handling stress of the initial transfer to experimental tanks. However, cortisol levels did not vary significantly between control and structured tanks at any point during the study. These results indicate that the addition of glass rod structures as hypothesised enrichment did not result in a measurable improvement in welfare. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effects of wall color stimuli on diving, and the effects of depth stimuli on scototaxis, were assessed in zebrafish. Three groups of fish were confined to a black, a white, or a transparent tank, and tested for depth preference. Two groups of fish were confined to a deep or a shallow tank, and tested for black-white preference. As predicted, fish preferred the deep half of a split-tank over the shallow half, and preferred the black half of a black/white tank over the white half. Results indicated that the tank wall color significantly affected depth preference, with the transparent tank producing the strongest depth preference and the black tank producing the weakest preference. Tank depth, however, did not significantly affect color preference. Additionally, wall color significantly affected shuttling and immobility, while depth significantly affected shuttling and thigmotaxis. These results are consistent with previous indications that the diving response and scototaxis may reflect dissociable mechanisms of behavior. We conclude that the two tests are complementary rather than interchangeable, and that further research on the motivational systems underlying behavior in each of the two tests is needed. © 2012 Blaser, Rosemberg.

AB  - Mescaline and phencyclidine (PCP) are potent hallucinogenic agents affecting human and animal behavior. As their psychotropic effects remain poorly understood, further research is necessary to characterize phenotypes they evoke in various animal models. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly emerging as a new model organism for neuroscience research. Here, we examine the effects of mescaline (5-20. mg/l) and PCP (0.5-3. mg/l) in several zebrafish paradigms, including the novel tank, open field and shoaling tests. Mescaline and PCP dose-dependently increased top activity in the novel tank test, also reducing immobility and disrupting the patterning of zebrafish swimming, as assessed by ethograms. PCP, but not mescaline, evoked circling behavior in the open field test. At the highest doses tested, mescaline markedly increased, while PCP did not affect, zebrafish shoaling behavior. Finally, 20. mg/l mescaline did not alter, and 3. mg/l PCP elevated, whole-body cortisol levels. Overall, our studies indicate high sensitivity of zebrafish models to hallucinogenic compounds with complex behavioral and physiological effects. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We examined depth preference in adult zebrafish in a modified visual cliff apparatus, in which distance from the water surface and distance from the substrate could be independently manipulated. In one condition, when the two sides of the apparatus genuinely differed in depth, subjects showed a powerful preference for the deeper side. In another condition, both sides of the tank were set to the same depth using a glass insert, but one side was made to appear deeper by placing gravel substrate just below the glass floor on one side, and far below the glass floor on the other, in an analogue of the visual cliff paradigm. Although terrestrial animals tend to avoid the 'deeper'-looking side of a visual cliff apparatus, zebrafish preferred the side that appeared deeper. They showed no preference for the side in which they could be closer to the gravel substrate. This effect appeared whether or not the gravel represented a novel stimulus for the fish. We conclude that escape from the surface, rather than approach to the substrate, motivates the diving response in zebrafish. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - One of the most commonly used behavioral endpoints measured in preclinical studies using rodent models is thigmotaxis (or "wall-hugging"). Thigmotaxis is a well-validated index of anxiety in animals and humans. While assays measuring thigmotaxis in adult zebrafish have been developed, a thigmotaxis assay has not yet been validated in larval zebrafish. Here we present a novel assay for measurement of thigmotaxis in zebrafish larvae that is triggered by a sudden change in illumination (i.e. sudden light-to-darkness transition) and performed in a standard 24-well plate. We show that zebrafish larvae as young as 5 days post fertilization respond to this challenge by engaging in thigmotaxis. Thigmotaxis was significantly attenuated by anxiolytic (diazepam) and significantly enhanced by anxiogenic (caffeine) drugs, thus representing the first validated thigmotaxis assay for larval zebrafish. We also show that exposure to sudden darkness per se may represent an anxiogenic situation for larval zebrafish since less contrasting light-to-darkness transitions (achieved by lowering darkness degrees) significantly decreased thigmotaxis levels in a manner similar to what was achieved with diazepam. These findings suggest that stimuli such as exposure to sudden darkness could be used proficiently to trigger the expression of anxiety-like behaviors in laboratory settings. In sum, this is a versatile protocol allowing testing of both anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs in a cost-effective manner (only 10. min). This assay is also amenable to medium to high-throughput capacity while constituting a valuable tool for stress and central nervous system research as well as for preclinical drug screening and discovery. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are widely used in neuroscience research, where their utility as a model organism is rapidly expanding. Low cost, ease of experimental manipulations, and sufficient behavioral complexity make zebrafish a valuable tool for high-throughput studies in biomedicine. To complement the available repositories for zebrafish genetic information, there is a growing need for the collection of zebrafish neurobehavioral and neurological phenotypes. For this, we are establishing the Zebrafish Neurophenome Database (ZND; www.tulane.edu/∼znpindex/search) as a new dynamic online open-access data repository for behavioral and related physiological data. ZND, currently focusing on adult zebrafish, combines zebrafish neurophenotypic data with a simple, easily searchable user interface, which allow scientists to view and compare results obtained by other laboratories using various treatments in different testing paradigms. As a developing community effort, ZND is expected to foster innovative research using zebrafish by federating the growing body of zebrafish neurophenotypic data. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Emotional responses are triggered by environmental signals and involve profound changes at multiple levels, from molecular to behavior. Much has been learnt about two emotions, fear and anxiety, by studying mammalian models. In particular, neural circuits and the corresponding molecular mechanisms essential for the learning and retention of fear, as well as the activation of anxiety, are well known. In contrast, little is known about how these emotions are terminated. The zebrafish is a newcomer to the world of emotion research. A number of assays for fear and anxiety now exist, but the underlying neural circuitry is largely undefined. Recent experiments, however, appear to provide a hint as to how anxiety is downregulated. In particular, they point to an essential role for a circuit involving the posterior septum, medial habenula, and interpeduncular nucleus. This evolutionarily conserved circuit may fulfill a similar function in mammals. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In teleosts, changes in swimming, exploring, general locomotor activity, and anxious state can be a response to stress mediated by the corticotropin-releasing hormone system activation and its effects on glucocorticoid levels. Zebrafish has been widely used to study neuropharmacology and has become a promising animal model to investigate neurobehavioral mechanisms of stress. In this report the animals were submitted to acute restraint stress for different time lengths (15, 60 and 90. min) for further evaluation of behavioral patterns, whole-body cortisol content, and corticotropin-releasing hormone expression. The results demonstrated an increase in the locomotor activity and an alteration in the swimming pattern during a 5-min trial after the acute restraint stress. Interestingly, all groups of fish tested in the novel tank test exhibited signs of anxiety as evaluated by the time spent in the bottom of the tank. Whole-body cortisol content showed a positive correlation with increased behavioral indices of locomotion in zebrafish whereas molecular analysis of corticotropin-releasing hormone showed a late reduction of mRNA expression (90. min). Altogether, we present a model of acute restraint stress in zebrafish, confirmed by elevated cortisol content, as a valid and reliable model to study the biochemical basis of stress behavior, which seems to be accompanied by a negative feedback of corticotropin-release hormone mRNA expression. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A major obstacle in treating drug addiction is the severity of opiate withdrawal syndrome, which can lead to unwanted relapse. Mitragynine is the major alkaloid compound found in leaves of Mitragyna speciosa, a plant widely used by opiate addicts to mitigate the harshness of drug withdrawal. A series of experiments was conducted to investigate the effect of mitragynine on anxiety behavior, cortisol level and expression of stress pathway related genes in zebrafish undergoing morphine withdrawal phase. Adult zebrafish were subjected to two weeks chronic morphine exposure at 1.5 mg/L, followed by withdrawal for 24 hours prior to tests. Using the novel tank diving tests, we first showed that morphine-withdrawn zebrafish display anxiety-related swimming behaviors such as decreased exploratory behavior and increased erratic movement. Morphine withdrawal also elevated whole-body cortisol levels, which confirms the phenotypic stress-like behaviors. Exposing morphine-withdrawn fish to mitragynine however attenuates majority of the stress-related swimming behaviors and concomitantly lower whole-body cortisol level. Using real-time PCR gene expression analysis, we also showed that mitragynine reduces the mRNA expression of corticotropin releasing factor receptors and prodynorphin in zebrafish brain during morphine withdrawal phase, revealing for the first time a possible link between mitragynine's ability to attenuate anxiety during opiate withdrawal with the stress-related corticotropin pathway. © 2011 Khor et al.

AB  - Correlated behavioural traits (behavioural syndromes) influence ecological interactions and, in turn, how natural selection shapes the evolution of behaviour. A major axis of intraspecific behavioural variation is the exploratory-boldness behavioural syndrome. Here, we describe how we sorted wild-caught zebrafish (Danio rerio) for increasing exploratory tendency using a serial open field maze. We then transferred test fish to a predator-inspection apparatus. Highly exploratory individuals spent more time near a novel predator than non-exploratory individuals, showing behavioural consistency indicative of an exploratory-boldness behavioural syndrome. We then bred the zebrafish to create F 1 offspring from four crosses: (1) exploratory × exploratory, (2) non-exploratory × non-exploratory, (3) exploratory females × non-exploratory males and (4) non-exploratory females × exploratory males. F 1 offspring were tested in a miniature serial open-field maze similar to the one used to sort the adults. Offspring of exploratory females were always highly exploratory regardless of the behavioural traits of the father suggesting that maternal effects may influence expression of exploratory-boldness behavioural syndrome in zebrafish. © 2011 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

AB  - Behaviour studies are used in toxicology research as they are excellent tools to measure physiological end-points caused by exogenous chemicals. In mammals both reproductive and non-reproductive behaviours have been used for a long period of time, whereas in teleost fishes non-reproductive behaviours have received little attention compared to reproductive behaviours. Recent advances in measuring stress related behaviours in zebrafish have provided additional tools to understand behaviour toxicology in fish. One species with well documented reproductive behaviour disturbed by different toxicants is the guppy, which is better suited than zebrafish for reproductive behaviour studies and therefore might be a better model organism for comparative behaviour studies in fish toxicology. Here we report new applications for non-reproductive behaviours in guppy and test these behaviours on males treated with the endocrine disruptor 17α-ethynylestradiol at environmentally relevant concentrations. 17α-ethynylestradiol increased freezing and bottom-dwelling when fish were placed in a non-familiar aquarium, but did not significantly affect shoaling behaviour. These results are similar to the anxiogenic behaviours seen in rats treated perinatally with 17α-ethynylestradiol and add more concern to the impacts of endocrine disruptors on aquatic wildlife. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is evaluating methods to screen and prioritize large numbers of chemicals for developmental toxicity. We are exploring methods to detect developmentally neurotoxic chemicals using zebrafish behavior at 6. days of age. The behavioral paradigm simultaneously tests individual larval zebrafish under both light and dark conditions in a 96-well plate using a video tracking system. We have found that many variables affect the level or pattern of locomotor activity, including age of the larvae, size of the well, and the presence of malformations. Some other variables, however, do not appear to affect larval behavior including type of rearing solution (10% Hank's vs. 1:3 Danieau vs 60. mg/kg Instant Ocean vs 1× and 1:10× EPA Moderately Hard Water). Zebrafish larval behavior using a microtiter plate format may be an ideal endpoint for screening developmentally neurotoxic chemicals, but it is imperative that many test variables be carefully specified and controlled. © 2011.

AB  - Ethanol has been suggested to have an anxiolytic effect on zebrafish, primarily based on its disruption of the novel tank diving response and of some social behaviors. The light/dark preference test offers a complementary measure of anxiety-like behavior in fish, and the purpose of the current study was to determine the effects of acute ethanol exposure on behavior in the light/dark task. In Experiment 1, the stimuli used to induce light/dark preference in zebrafish were varied in order to determine how best to measure the behavior. Subjects exhibited phototaxis (preference for light) when illumination was manipulated, but scototaxis (preference for dark) when wall and substrate color were manipulated. There was a clear interaction between locomotor activity and color preference, with animals preferentially freezing in darker locations. Because of ambiguity in interpreting behavior in the open/covered version of the test, the black/white version was used in Experiment 2. In Experiment 2, zebrafish were exposed to ethanol (0.25%, 0.5%, or 1.0%) or water for 30 minutes, and then placed in a black/white preference tank containing either ethanol (same doses) or water for a 30-minute test. Ethanol exposure increased locomotor activity and reduced freezing. Additionally, there was a significant interaction between ethanol treatment and locomotor activity on side preference. Low doses of ethanol increased white avoidance in normally swimming fish, while high doses did not. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Behavioral syndromes are suites of two or more behaviors that correlate across environmental contexts. The aggression-boldness syndrome links aggression, boldness, and exploratory activity in a novel environment. Although aggression-boldness has been described in many animals, the mechanism linking its behavioral components is not known. Here we show that mutation of the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor receptor 1a (fgfr1a) simultaneously increases aggression, boldness, and exploration in adult zebrafish. We demonstrate that altered Fgf signaling also results in reduced brain histamine levels in mutants. Pharmacological increase of histamine signaling is sufficient to rescue the behavioral phenotype of fgfr1a mutants. Together, we show that a single genetic locus can underlie the aggression- boldness behavioral syndrome. We also identify one of the neurotransmitter pathways that may mediate clustering of these behaviors. © 2011 the authors.

AB  - The light/dark preference test is commonly used to assess anxiety-like phenotypes and validate the pharmacological effects of neuroactive compounds. This test has been recently adapted for adult zebrafish but has not yet been characterized and pharmacologically validated for young juvenile zebrafish. In the present study, we provide a detailed description of the pattern of exploratory behaviours encountered in juvenile zebrafish when exposed to the light/dark preference test. We report that juveniles display strong dark-avoidance behaviours in this test. Specifically, juveniles spent significantly less time, displayed high latency to enter and moved significantly less in the dark compartment relative to the white compartment of the testing apparatus. The expression of these dark-avoidance behaviours was significantly attenuated and increased by commonly used anxiolytic (diazepam, buspirone, ethanol) and anxiogenic (caffeine but not FG-7142) drugs, respectively. We also show that the expression of dark-avoidance behaviours can be significantly reduced in a manner similar to what is achieved with anxiolytic drugs, simply by decreasing the contrast between the white and dark zones, which made the dark zone less dark.Taken together, these findings provide the first pharmacological validation of the light/dark preference test for juvenile zebrafish and ascertain the nature of dark-avoidance behaviours as anxiety-like behaviours in young juvenile zebrafish. This behavioural-based assay is also versatile and can accommodate drug screening of both anxiolytic and anxiogenic compounds while eventually amenable to automation and high-throughput capacity in a near future. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ethinyl estradiol is a potent endocrine disrupting compound in fish and ubiquitously present in the aquatic environment. In this study, we exposed adult zebra fish (Danio rerio) males to 0, 5 or 25 ng Ethinyl estradiol/L for 14 days and analyzed the effects on non-reproductive behavior. Effects of treatment of the exposed males was shown by vitellogenin induction, while brain aromatase (CYP 19B) activity was not significantly altered. Both concentrations of Ethinyl estradiol significantly altered the behavior in the Novel tank test, where anxiety is determined as the tendency to stay at the bottom when introduced into an unfamiliar environment. The effects were, however, opposite for the two concentrations. Fish that were exposed to 5 ng/L had longer latency before upswim, fewer transitions to the upper half and shorter total time spent in the upper half compared with control fish, while 25 ng Ethinyl estradiol treatment resulted in shorter latency and more and longer visits to the upper half. The swimming activity of 25, but not 5 ng-exposed fish were slightly but significantly reduced, and these fish tended to spend a lot of time at the surface. We also studied the shoaling behavior as the tendency to leave a shoal of littermates trapped behind a Plexiglas barrier at one end of the test tank. The fish treated with Ethinyl estradiol had significantly longer latency before leaving shoal mates and left the shoal fewer times. Further, the fish exposed to 5 ng/L also spent significantly less time away from shoal than control fish. Fertilization frequency was higher in males exposed to 5 ng/L Ethinyl estradiol when compared with control males, while no spawning was observed after treatment with 25 ng/L. The testes from both treatment groups contained a normal distribution of spermatogenesis stages, and no abnormality in testis morphology could be observed.In conclusion, we have observed effects on two behaviors not related to reproduction in zebra fish males after treatment with Ethinyl estradiol, adding to the ecological consequences of contamination of aquatic environments with estrogenic substances. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The study of the causes and mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders requires the use of non-human models for the test of scientific hypotheses as well as for use in pre-clinical drug screening and discovery. This review argues in favor of the use of zebrafish as a novel animal model to study the impact of early (stressful) experiences on the development of differential stress phenotypes in later life. This phenomenon is evolutionary conserved among several vertebrate species and has relevance to the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Why do we need novel animal models? Although significant progress has been achieved with the use of traditional mammalian models, there are major pitfalls associated with their use that impedes progress on two major fronts: 1) uncovering of the molecular mechanisms underlying aspects of compromised (stress-exposed) brain development relevant to the etiology of psychiatric disorders, and 2) ability to develop high-throughput technology for drug discovery in the field of psychiatry. The zebrafish model helps resolve these issues.Here we present a conceptual framework for the use of zebrafish in stress research and psychiatry by addressing three specific domains of application: 1) stress research, 2) human disease mechanisms, and 3) drug discovery. We also present novel methodologies associated with the development of the zebrafish stress model and discuss how such methodologies can contribute to remove the main bottleneck in the field of drug discovery. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') is a potent psychedelic drug inducing euphoria and hypersociability in humans, as well as hyperactivity and anxiety in rodents. Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) have become a widely used species in neurobehavioral research. Here, we explore the effects of a wide range (0.25-120 mg/l) of acute MDMA doses on zebrafish behavior in the novel tank test. Although MDMA was inactive at lower doses (0.25-10 mg/l), higher doses reduced bottom swimming and immobility (40-120 mg/l) and impaired intrasession habituation (10-120 mg/l). MDMA also elevated brain c-fos expression, collectively confirming the usage of zebrafish models for screening of hallucinogenic compounds. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - The open tank paradigm, also known as novel tank diving test, is a protocol used to evaluate the zebrafish behavior. Several characteristics have been described for this species, including scototaxis, which is the natural preference for dark environments in detriment of bright ones. However, there is no evidence regarding the influence of "natural stimuli" in zebrafish subjected to novelty-based paradigms. In this report, we evaluated the spatio-temporal exploratory activity of the short-fin zebrafish phenotype in the open tank after a short-period confinement into dark/bright environments. A total of 44 animals were individually confined during a 10-min single session into one of three environments: black-painted, white-painted, and transparent cylinders (dark, bright, and transparent groups). Fish were further subjected to the novel tank test and their exploratory profile was recorded during a 15-min trial. The results demonstrated that zebrafish increased their vertical exploratory activity during the first 6-min, where the bright group spent more time and travelled a higher distance in the top area. Interestingly, all behavioral parameters measured for the dark group were similar to the transparent one. These data were confirmed by automated analysis of track and occupancy plots and also demonstrated that zebrafish display a classical homebase formation in the bottom area of the tank. A detailed spatio-temporal study of zebrafish exploratory behavior and the construction of representative ethograms showed that the experimental groups presented significant differences in the first 3-min vs. last 3-min of test. Although the main factors involved in these behavioral responses still remain ambiguous and require further investigation, the current report describes an alternative methodological approach for assessing the zebrafish behavior after a forced exposure to different environments. Additionally, the analysis of ethologically-relevant patterns across time could be a potential phenotyping tool to evaluate the zebrafish exploratory profile in the open tank task. © 2011 Rosemberg et al.

AB  - Pain is a major symptom in many medical conditions, and often interferes significantly with a person's quality of life. Although a priority topic in medical research for many years, there are still few analgesic drugs approved for clinical use. One reason is the lack of appropriate animal models that faithfully represent relevant hallmarks associated with human pain. Here we propose zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a novel short-term behavioral model of nociception, and analyse its sensitivity and robustness. Firstly, we injected two different doses of acetic acid as the noxious stimulus. We studied individual locomotor responses of fish to a threshold level of nociception using two recording systems: a video tracking system and an electric biosensor (the MOBS system). We showed that an injection dose of 10% acetic acid resulted in a change in behavior that could be used to study nociception. Secondly, we validated our behavioral model by investigating the effect of the analgesic morphine. In time-course studies, first we looked at the dose-response relationship of morphine and then tested whether the effect of morphine could be modulated by naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Our results suggest that a change in behavioral responses of zebrafish to acetic acid is a reasonable model to test analgesics. The response scales with stimulus intensity, is attenuated by morphine, and the analgesic effect of morphine is blocked with naloxone. The change in behavior of zebrafish associated with the noxious stimulus can be monitored with an electric biosensor that measures changes in water impedance. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Ethanol and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) are commonly used as carrier solvents for lipophilic chemicals in aquatic toxicity bioassays. However, very little information has been reported on the behavioral effects of these solvents. In this study, we examined the effects of ethanol and DMSO on development and locomotor activity by a zebrafish embryo-larval bioassay. The zebrafish were exposed to different concentrations (control, 0.01, 0.1, and 1%) of ethanol or DMSO from blastula stage to 144. hour-post-fertilization (hpf). Hatchability, survival, and abnormalities were monitored every 12. h, and locomotor activity of the larvae was analyzed at 144. hpf. Hatchability was not affected by the ethanol or DMSO treatments. No effect on survival was observed except the 1% ethanol group suffered 89% mortality during 108-120. hpf. No developmental defects were observed in any of the solvents at the 0.01 and 0.1% concentrations, but significantly higher deformity rates occurred with 1% ethanol and DMSO groups. Hyperactivity and less tortuous swimming paths were observed in all ethanol and DMSO concentrations. Based on this study, we suggest that data of behavioral toxicity bioassays using ethanol or DMSO as carrier solvents should be interpreted cautiously, because the solvents at low concentrations could alter locomotor activity of larval zebrafish without causing any observable developmental defects. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The scototaxis test has been introduced recently to assess anxiety-like phenotypes in fish, including zebrafish. Parametric analyses suggest that scototaxis represents an approach-avoidance conflict, which hints at anxiety. In this model, white avoidance represents anxiety-like behavior, while the number of shuttling events represents activity. Acute or chronic fluoxetine, buspirone, benzodiazepines, ethanol, caffeine and dizocilpine were assessed using the light-dark box (scototaxis) test in zebrafish. Acute fluoxetine treatment did not alter white avoidance, but altered locomotion in the higher dose; chronic treatment (2. weeks), on the other hand, produced an anxiolytic effect with no locomotor outcomes. The benzodiazepines produced a hormetic (inverted U-shaped) dose-response profile, with intermediate doses producing anxiolysis and no effect at higher doses; clonazepam, a high-potency benzodiazepine agonist, produced a locomotor impairment at the highest dose. Buspirone produced an anxiolytic profile, without locomotor impairments. Moclobemide did not produce behavioral effects. Ethanol also produced a hormetic profile in white avoidance, with locomotor activation in 0.5% concentration. Caffeine produced an anxiogenic profile, without locomotor effects. These results suggest that the light-dark box is sensitive to anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs in zebrafish. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The use of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in neurobehavioral research is rapidly expanding. The present large-scale study applied the newest video-tracking and data-mining technologies to further examine zebrafish anxiety-like phenotypes. Here, we generated temporal and spatial three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of zebrafish locomotion, globally assessed behavioral profiles evoked by several anxiogenic and anxiolytic manipulations, mapped individual endpoints to 3D reconstructions, and performed cluster analysis to reconfirm behavioral correlates of high- and low-anxiety states. The application of 3D swim path reconstructions consolidates behavioral data (while increasing data density) and provides a novel way to examine and represent zebrafish behavior. It also enables rapid optimization of video tracking settings to improve quantification of automated parameters, and suggests that spatiotemporal organization of zebrafish swimming activity can be affected by various experimental manipulations in a manner predicted by their anxiolytic or anxiogenic nature. Our approach markedly enhances the power of zebrafish behavioral analyses, providing innovative framework for high-throughput 3D phenotyping of adult zebrafish behavior. © 2011 Cachat et al.

AB  - Environmental silver exposures are increasing due to the use of silver nanoparticles, which exert antimicrobial actions by releasing Ag+, a suspected developmental neurotoxicant. We evaluated the long-term neurochemical and behavioral effects of embryonic Ag+ exposure in zebrafish at concentrations that had no overt effects on morphological development. Exposure to 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3μM Ag+ during the first five days post-fertilization caused elevations in both dopamine and serotonin turnover in the adult zebrafish brain without affecting basal neurotransmitter levels. Consistent with these synaptic effects, Ag+-exposed fish showed a faster acquisition of avoidance behavior in a three-chamber test apparatus, without any change in response latency or overall swimming ability. Our results indicate that Ag+ is a developmental neurotoxicant that causes persistent neurobehavioral effects, reinforcing health concerns about Ag+ released from silver nanoparticles. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Although the chronotoxicity of xenobiotics is relatively well known in mammals, the existence of daily rhythms of drug toxicity and effectiveness in fish has been neglected to date. The aim of this research was to investigate the influence of the time (middle of the light phase [ML] versus middle of the dark phase [MD]) of exposure to two anesthetic substances (MS-222 or clove oil) commonly used with fish on the median lethal concentration (LC50) and swimming activity of zebrafish (Danio rerio). To this end, adult zebrafish were kept under a 12h:12h light-dark (LD) cycle and exposed to different concentrations of the anesthetics for 15min at ML or MD. LC50 calculations were performed using the Spearman-Karber program, whereas swimming activity was video-recorded and analyzed with specialized software. Zebrafish exhibited a mostly diurnal activity pattern (77.9% of activity occurring during daytime). The acute toxicity and mortality caused by MS-222 and eugenol varied with the time of exposure. For MS-222, the LC50 was 170.6±7.4mgL in fish exposed at ML and 215.6±3.9mgL at MD, whereas for eugenol the LC50 was 70.3±3.1mgL at ML and 104.9±5.4mgL at MD. Exposure to sublethal concentrations of MS-222 and eugenol altered the swimming patterns of zebrafish in a different manner depending on the time of exposure. Thus, the time required for decreasing swimming activity during exposure to anesthetics was shorter at ML than at MD, whereas the recovery period was longer during the day. In conclusion, these results revealed that the toxicity and effectiveness of both anesthetic substances is highest during daytime, the active phase of fish, thus suggesting a link between the daily rhythms of behavior and toxicity. © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - Mounting evidence implicates the zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) as a promising model species for reward and addiction research. Modeling drug abuse-related behavior in both adult and larval zebrafish produced a wealth of clinically translatable data, also demonstrating their sensitivity to various drugs of abuse and the ability to develop tolerance. Several studies have also applied withdrawal paradigms to model the adverse effects of drug abuse in zebrafish. In this review, we summarize recent findings of a wide spectrum of zebrafish drug abuse-related behavioral and physiological phenotypes, discuss the existing challenges, and outline potential future directions of research in this field.

AB  - Various novelty-based assays used to quantify zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavior show a striking similarity to behavioral responses in rodents. Exposed to the open field test, zebrafish establish overt homebases demonstrating clear preference for a particular area of the tank. This behavior aims to establish a "safe zone" that zebrafish can familiarize themselves with and feel secure in, and is similar to homebase behaviors of various laboratory rodent species. Here we outline a simple protocol for homebase phenotyping in zebrafish. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The development of reliable pharmacological screening assays is an important task. However, it is based upon the ability of animal models, such as the zebrafish, to demonstrate predictive validity for a specific set of drug classes. A popular assay used for this purpose is the novel tank diving paradigm, where zebrafish behavior can easily be modulated by anxiolytic or anxiogenic drug exposure. However, predictive validity may fail to provide crucial information about the model, such as comparisons of drug efficacy and the effects of drugs on varying behavioral phenotypes. This deficit is accounted for by a novel measure termed the Maximum Predictive Value (MPV), which provides an estimate of how sensitive a particular model is when assessing its potential pharmacologically. Here we provide a protocol detailing how to employ this measure to validate behavioral endpoints in the novel tank test for use in pharmacological studies in zebrafish. Similar approaches can be used to examine drug efficacy in other zebrafish-based behavioral tests. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Three-dimensional reconstruction is a method of qualifying the behavioral activity of several animals including mice, rats, and zebrafish. This method allows for measuring behavioral endpoint data on two types of tracking planes (temporal and spatial). Temporal tracking measures the activity of a subject across time while spatial tracking measures the activity of a subject in a specific area of the experimental arena as such. Data representation over 3D visual trajectory reconstruction is a robustly advantageous method of behavioral phenotyping. Digital video-tracking and analysis eliminates the inaccuracies of manual tracking and allows for improved investigation of behavioral activity at specific points in time or specific areas of the tracking arena. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This protocol is for a light/dark plus maze novel environment test utilizing two elements of those behavioral responses, thigmotaxis and light avoidance, to assess "anxiety states" in zebrafish. The test is based upon the rodent elevated plus maze and is scored similarly, except for fish white arms replace opened arms, and black arms parallel closed arms. Several pharmaceuticals that reduce anxiety levels in patients and increase open arm exploration by rodents in the elevated plus maze also increase zebrafish entries into and time spent in white arms of the maze. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Due to physiological and anatomical similarities to other vertebrates, zebrafish are becoming a widely used model in neurobehavioral research. With the growing popularity of zebrafish as experimental subjects, it is important to develop tools that accurately record their behavioral phenotypes. Video-aided analysis of zebrafish behavior offers an increased spectrum of behavioral endpoints, some of which are not available using traditional (manual) observation. In addition, the use of computer software allows quantification of certain zebrafish behaviors that are otherwise highly subjective. This protocol describes a method for fast, accurate, and consistent video-aided measurements of zebrafish locomotion and anxiety-related behavior. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The light/dark box test, traditionally used to quantify rodent anxiety-like behavior, has recently been applied to the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). Utilizing the fish's scototaxis (aversion to bright areas and natural preference for the dark), this paradigm can be used to assess levels of anxiety in adult zebrafish. The light/dark box is a simple and time-efficient one-trial test that does not require pre-training the animals. Importantly, this novelty-based paradigm may also represent a useful tool for studying the pharmacological modulation of zebrafish behavior. Summarizing the experience with this model in several laboratories, here we outline a protocol for the neurophenoptyping of zebrafish anxiety-like behavior using the light/dark paradigm. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Associative learning is a form of classical (Pavlovian) conditioning in which a neutral stimulus (e.g., the color green) is paired with a stimulus of some significance to an animal (e.g., food), such that for the animal, the color becomes synonymous with food to evoke the same innate, reflexive behavioral responses (e.g., food seeking). This protocol is designed to test the acquisition and extinction of reward-visual stimulus association in zebrafish (Danio rerio) in a T-maze. It is based on the visual discrimination protocol of Colwill et al. (2005), in which colors or patterns are paired with a food reward. The protocol has been modified to include a reward box within the T-maze aquarium so that the influence of drug reinforcement can be studied without the potential confound of reward residues contaminating the testing arena. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Zebrafish have been demonstrated to react consistently to noxious chemical stimuli and present reliable phenotypes of stress, fear, and anxiety. In this article, we describe the modulation of nociceptive-like responses of zebrafish to fear-, stress-, and anxiety-eliciting situations. Animals were exposed to an alarm substance, confinement stress, or a novel environment before being injected with 1% acetic acid in the tail. The alarm substance and confinement stress reduced the display of erratic movements and tail-beating behavior elicited by acetic acid. The novelty of the environment, in contrast, increased the frequency of tail-beating behavior. The results suggest that descending modulatory control of nociception exists in zebrafish, with apparent fear- and stress-induced analgesia and anxiety-induced hyperalgesia.

AB  - We present a method that complements both scoring by observers and automated tracking methods for quantifying behaviors. Based on standard motion enhancement, our algorithm converts a behavioral video recording into a single image ('videogram') that maps the spatial distribution of activity in the video sequence. This videogram can be used as a visual summary of activity and also as a direct, repeatable, and unbiased measure of animal activity. We describe the algorithm, and then use videograms to show acquisition of odorant-dependent place-conditioning in zebrafish trained in groups. We also demonstrate its potential for determining depth preferences and swimming speeds. This method generates activity measurements suitable for continuous variable statistics, and can be considered as an analysis alternative to behavioral tracking (over which it can have several advantages) for experiments not requiring exact trajectories. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The current study provides a detailed description of the pattern of exploratory behaviors encountered in adult zebrafish when exposed to a novel/unfamiliar environment using the light/dark box and open field tests. We also document the impact of an acute stressor (restraint stress) given just prior the onset of behavioral testing. We report the following main findings: (1) zebrafish display anxiety-like behaviors including dark-avoidance (in light/. dark box test) and thigmotaxis (in open field test), (2) upon exposure to a novel environment (first 2. min), zebrafish display place preference for the outer zone of the testing apparatus where they seek escape via the transparent wall, and exhibit high locomotor activity accompanied by high swimming speed, (3) thigmotaxis, behavioral hyperactivity, and swimming speed habituate (decrease) over time, (4) prior history of stress attenuates the natural tendency to engage in dark-avoidance behavior and thigmotaxis, reduces attempts to escape via the transparent wall, and greatly increased behavioral hyperactivity and swimming speed. Stress-induced patterns of behavior normalize to levels comparable to that of non-stressed controls by the end of the 5-min test session.Taken together, these findings suggest that novel environment can elicit anxiety-like behaviors in zebrafish such as dark-avoidance and thigmotaxis and the prior history of stress greatly affects patterns of exploration, defensive behaviors, and coping strategies in the light/. dark box and open field tests. These findings are consistent with previous findings in rodents and support the usefulness of such behavioral paradigms in zebrafish. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent hallucinogenic drug that strongly affects animal and human behavior. Although adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) are emerging as a promising neurobehavioral model, the effects of LSD on zebrafish have not been investigated previously. Several behavioral paradigms (the novel tank, observation cylinder, light-dark box, open field, T-maze, social preference and shoaling tests), as well as modern video-tracking tools and whole-body cortisol assay were used to characterize the effects of acute LSD in zebrafish. While lower doses (5-100μg/L) did not affect zebrafish behavior, 250μg/L LSD increased top dwelling and reduced freezing in the novel tank and observation cylinder tests, also affecting spatiotemporal patterns of activity (as assessed by 3D reconstruction of zebrafish traces and ethograms). LSD evoked mild thigmotaxis in the open field test, increased light behavior in the light-dark test, reduced the number of arm entries and freezing in the T-maze and social preference test, without affecting social preference. In contrast, LSD affected zebrafish shoaling (increasing the inter-fish distance in a group), and elevated whole-body cortisol levels. Overall, our findings show sensitivity of zebrafish to LSD action, and support the use of zebrafish models to study hallucinogenic drugs of abuse. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Several behavioral assays are currently used for high-throughput neurophenotyping and screening of genetic mutations and psychotropic drugs in zebrafish (Danio rerio). In this protocol, we describe a battery of two assays to characterize anxiety-related behavioral and endocrine phenotypes in adult zebrafish. Here, we detail how to use the 'novel tank' test to assess behavioral indices of anxiety (including reduced exploration, increased freezing behavior and erratic movement), which are quantifiable using manual registration and computer-aided video-tracking analyses. In addition, we describe how to analyze whole-body zebrafish cortisol concentrations that correspond to their behavior in the novel tank test. This protocol is an easy, inexpensive and effective alternative to other methods of measuring stress responses in zebrafish, thus enabling the rapid acquisition and analysis of large amounts of data. As will be shown here, fish anxiety-like behavior can be either attenuated or exaggerated depending on stress or drug exposure, with cortisol levels generally expected to parallel anxiety behaviors. This protocol can be completed over the course of 2 d, with a variable testing duration depending on the number of fish used. © 2010 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) have recently been suggested as a high-throughput experimental model of epilepsy-related pathogenetic states. Here we use adult zebrafish to study behavioral symptoms associated with drug-evoked seizures. Experimental epilepsy-like states were evoked in zebrafish by exposure for 20 min to three chemoconvulsant drugs: caffeine (250 mg/L; 1.3 mM), pentylenetetrazole (1.5 g/L; 11.0 mM) and picrotoxin (100 mg/L; 0.17 mM). Fish behavior was analyzed using manual and video-tracking methods (Noldus Ethovision XT7). Compared to their respective controls, all three drug-treated groups showed robust seizure-like responses (hyperactivity bouts, spasms, circular and corkscrew swimming) accompanied by elevated whole-body cortisol levels (assessed by ELISA). In contrast, control fish did not display seizure-like behaviors and had significantly lower cortisol levels. Paralleling behavioral and endocrine phenotypes observed in clinical and rodent studies, our data implicates adult zebrafish as an emerging experimental model for epilepsy research. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Comparative studies on neural plasticity in non-mammalian vertebrates are increasingly promoted as an important complement to mammalian models. In teleost fishes the number of brain cells increases with age, body weight, and body length throughout life. Neurogenesis persists to a large degree, and both neuron replacement and net brain growth occur during adulthood. Whether environmental factors affect brain cell proliferation has however been scarcely investigated in this animal group. In the current study adult male zebrafish were kept in social isolation in different environments (enriched vs. barren) for one week. Telencephalic cell proliferation was investigated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry. Higher numbers of PCNA positive nuclei and significantly increased inter-individual variability was observed in fish kept in aquaria enriched with artificial plants and gravel. Zebrafish rapidly regained feed intake after transfer to social isolation. Whole-body cortisol levels were also generally low in isolated fish, although slightly elevated in fish from enriched environments. In summary, this study demonstrates that environmental alterations can rapidly alter cell cycle dynamics in the zebrafish brain. Furthermore, the results support the idea that mild short-term stressors and concomitant small increases in corticosteroid exposure stimulate brain cell proliferation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Despite growing evidence of the detrimental effect of chemical substances on organisms, limited research has focused on changes in behavioral patterns, in part due to the difficulties to obtain detailed quantitative data. Recent developments in efficient computer-based video analyses have allowed testing pesticide effects on model species such as the zebrafish. However, these new techniques have not yet been applied to amphibians and directly to conservation issues, i.e., to assess toxicological risks on threatened species. We used video-tracking analyses to test a quantitative effect of an environmental contaminant on the locomotion of amphibian tadpoles (Rana temporaria) by taking into account cumulative effects. Because recent research has demonstrated effects of de-icing salts on survival and community structure, we used sodium chloride in our experimental design (25 replicates, 4 concentrations, 4 times) to test for an effect at the scale of behavior at environmentally relevant concentrations. Analysis of 372 1-h video-tracks (5 samples/s) showed a complex action of salts on behavioral patterns with a dose and cumulative response over time. Although no effects were found on mortality or growth, the highest salt concentrations reduced the speed and movement of tadpoles in comparison with control treatments. The reduced locomotor performance could have detrimental consequences in terms of tadpoles' responses to competition and predation and may be an indicator of the low concentration effect of the contaminant. On one hand, this study demonstrates the usefulness of examining behavior to address conservation issues and understand the complex action of environmental factors and, more particularly, pollutants on organisms. On the other hand, our results highlight the need of new computerized techniques to quantitatively analyze these patterns. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Analysis of habituation is widely used to characterize animal cognitive phenotypes and their modulation. Although zebrafish (Danio rerio) are increasingly utilized in neurobehavioral research, their habituation responses have not been extensively investigated. Utilizing the novel tank test, we examine intra- and inter-session habituation and demonstrate robust habituation responses in adult zebrafish. Analyzing the intra-session habituation to novelty further, we also show that selected anxiogenic drugs (caffeine, pentylenetetrazole), as well as stress-inducing alarm pheromone, attenuated zebrafish habituation. Some acute anxiolytic agents, such as morphine and ethanol, while predictably reducing zebrafish anxiety, had no effects on habituation. Chronic ethanol and fluoxetine treatments improved intra-session habituation in zebrafish. In general, our study parallels literature on rodent habituation responses to novelty, and reconfirms zebrafish as a promising model for cognitive neurobehavioral research. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is rapidly becoming a popular model species in behavioral neuroscience research. Zebrafish behavior is robustly affected by environmental and pharmacological manipulations, and can be examined using exploration-based paradigms, paralleled by analysis of endocrine (cortisol) stress responses. Discontinuation of various psychotropic drugs evokes withdrawal in both humans and rodents, characterized by increased anxiety. Sensitivity of zebrafish to drugs of abuse has been recently reported in the literature. Here we examine the effects of ethanol, diazepam, morphine and caffeine withdrawal on zebrafish behavior. Overall, discontinuation of ethanol, diazepam and morphine produced anxiogenic-like behavioral or endocrine responses, demonstrating the utility of zebrafish in translational research of withdrawal syndrome. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - While zebrafish may be a useful behavioral model of human anxiety, it is not obvious which behaviors are accurate measures of anxiety in zebrafish. Beginning with the premise that the most fundamental indicator of fear is avoidance, the goal of the current study was to determine which behaviors are systematically observed in the presence of an avoided stimulus. In a dark/bright preference task, adult zebrafish preferred a black chamber and avoided a white chamber. Then, subjects were confined to each chamber, and their behaviors recorded. A principal component analysis was used to determine which behaviors clustered with the tendency to avoid white. Additionally, the behaviors of High-avoidant and Low-avoidant animals were compared using analysis of variance. Results indicate that confinement to white systematically elicited freezing in animals with a strong dark preference, but not in animals with little preference. Turn rate (erratic movement) was weakly related to avoidance, while thigmotaxis and locomotor activity were poor predictors. Freezing is therefore suggested to be a viable measure of white-induced anxiety, while interpretation of the other behaviors is more ambiguous and will require further investigation. © 2009 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) an organophosphate pesticide causes persisting behavioral dysfunction in rat models when exposure is during early development. In earlier work zebrafish were used as a complementary model to study mechanisms of CPF-induced neurotoxicity induced during early development. We found that developmental (first five days after fertilization) chlorpyrifos exposure significantly impaired learning in zebrafish. However, this testing was time and labor intensive. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that persisting effects of developmental chlorpyrifos could be detected with a brief automated assessment of startle response and that this behavioral index could be used to help determine the neurobehavioral mechanisms for persisting CPF effects. The swimming activity of adult zebrafish was assessed by a computerized video-tracking device after a sudden tap to the test arena. Ten consecutive trials (1/min) were run to determine startle response and its habituation. Additionally, habituation recovery trials were run at 8, 32 and 128 min after the end of the initial trial set. CPF-exposed fish showed a significantly (p < 0.025) greater overall startle response during the 10-trial session compared to controls (group sizes: Control N = 40, CPF N = 24). During the initial recovery period (8 min) CPF-exposed fish showed a significantly (p < 0.01) greater startle response compared to controls. To elucidate the contributions of nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors to developmental CPF-mediated effects, the effects of developmental nicotine and pilocarpine exposure throughout the first five days after fertilization were determined. Developmental nicotine and pilocarpine exposure significantly increased startle response, though nicotine (group sizes: Control N = 32, 15 mM N = 12, 25 mM N = 20) was much more potent than pilocarpine (group sizes: Control N = 20, 100 μM N = 16, 1000 μM N = 12). Neither was as potent as CPF for developmental exposure increasing startle response in adulthood. Lastly, developmental CPF exposure decreased dopamine and serotonin levels and increased transmitter turnover in developing zebrafish larvae (N = 4 batches of 50 embryos/treatment). Only the decline in dopamine concentrations persisted into adulthood (group sizes: Control N = 14, CPF N = 13). This study shows that a quick automated test of startle can detect persisting neurobehavioral impairments caused by developmental exposure to CPF. This may be helpful in screening for persisting neurobehavioral defects from a variety of toxicants. © 2009.

AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is emerging as a promising model organism for experimental studies of stress and anxiety. Here we further validate zebrafish models of stress by analyzing how environmental and pharmacological manipulations affect their behavioral and physiological phenotypes. Experimental manipulations included exposure to alarm pheromone, chronic exposure to fluoxetine, acute exposure to caffeine, as well as acute and chronic exposure to ethanol. Acute (but not chronic) alarm pheromone and acute caffeine produced robust anxiogenic effects, including reduced exploration, increased erratic movements and freezing behavior in zebrafish tested in the novel tank diving test. In contrast, ethanol and fluoxetine had robust anxiolytic effects, including increased exploration and reduced erratic movements. The behavior of several zebrafish strains was also quantified to ascertain differences in their behavioral profiles, revealing high-anxiety (leopard, albino) and low-anxiety (wild type) strains. We also used LocoScan (CleverSys Inc.) video-tracking tool to quantify anxiety-related behaviors in zebrafish, and dissect anxiety-related phenotypes from locomotor activity. Finally, we developed a simple and effective method of measuring zebrafish physiological stress responses (based on a human salivary cortisol assay), and showed that alterations in whole-body cortisol levels in zebrafish parallel behavioral indices of anxiety. Collectively, our results confirm zebrafish as a valid, reliable, and high-throughput model of stress and affective disorders. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Zebrafish are becoming more widely used to study neurobehavioral pharmacology. We have developed a method to assess novel environment diving behavior of zebrafish as a model of stress response and anxiolytic drug effects. In a novel tank, zebrafish dwell in the bottom of the tank initially and then increase their swimming exploration to higher levels over time. We previously found that nicotine, which has anxiolytic effects in rodents and humans, significantly lessens the novel tank diving response in zebrafish. The specificity of the diving effect was validated with a novel vs. non-novel test tank. The novel tank diving response of zebrafish was tested when given three anxiolytic drugs from two different chemical and pharmacological classes: buspirone, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam. When the test tank was novel the diving response was clearly seen whereas it was significantly reduced when the test tank was not novel. Buspirone, a serotonergic (5HT1A receptor agonist) anxiolytic drug with some D2 dopaminergic effect, had a pronounced anxiolytic-like effect in the zebrafish diving model at doses that did not have sedative effects. In contrast, chlordiazepoxide, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug, which is an effective agonist at GABA-A receptors, did not produce signs of anxiolysis in zebrafish over a broad dose range up to those that caused sedation. Diazepam another benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug did produce an anxiolytic effect at doses that did not cause sedation. The zebrafish novel tank diving task can be useful in discriminating anxiolytic drugs of several classes (serotonergic, benzodiazepines and nicotinic). © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Zebrafish is gaining popularity in basic behavioral brain research, behavior genetics, and in translational studies because it offers a cheap and efficient alternative to rodents. Abnormally exaggerated fear and anxiety are some of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric diseases in the human society whose mechanisms are not well understood. These diseases still represent major unmet medical needs. Ethologically relevant fear paradigms involving the presentation of predators, or of stimuli characteristic of predators, have been proposed as appropriate for the modeling and the analysis of fear responses. Previously, we have shown that zebrafish respond specifically to visual stimuli of their sympatric predator, the Indian leaf fish. In the current paper we show that an animated (moving) image of this predator elicits significant behavioral responses and that these responses can be quantified using video-tracking. As stimulus presentation and behavioral response quantification are both computerized and automated, we suggest the paradigm is appropriate for high throughput screening and, once pharmacologically and behaviorally validated, may have utility in the detection of anxiolytic or anxiogenic properties of compounds or in the identification of fear altering mutations. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This is the first study analysing individual differences in shyness-boldness and behavioural asymmetries in young zebrafish larvae (fry, 7 days post-fertilisation). Individual differences were more stable in tests with predator model (crude image of a fish face) than with an arbitrary novel stimulus (vertical black stripe). Principal component analysis revealed a dimension of 'shyness' that involved the tendency of fry to avoid a predator model and reduced locomotion in its presence. The fry took longer to enter a novel environment and kept at greater distance when the stimulus was first seen with the left rather than right eye. Individual differences in eye use were consistent with either novel stimulus or predator model, but there was no correlation between these two contexts. Shyness correlated with left eye bias for viewing novel stimulus but not predator model. Development of eggs and larvae in darkness during the first six days after fertilisation increased shyness and reduced behavioural asymmetries in response to the predator model. © 2009 BRILL.

AB  - The increasing use of zebrafish (Danio rerio) in developmental research highlights the need for a detailed understanding of their behavior. We studied the locomotion of individual zebrafish larva (6 days post-fertilization) in 96-well microtiter plates. Movement was recorded using a video-tracking system. Time of day results indicated locomotion, tested in darkness (infrared), decreased gradually from early morning to a stable level between 13:00 and 15:30 h. All further studies were conducted in early-to-late afternoon and lasted approximately 1 h. Each study also began with a period of darkness to minimize any unintended stimulation caused by transferring the plates to the recording platform. Locomotion in darkness increased initially to a maximum at 4 min, then decreased steadily to a low level by 20 min. Locomotion during light was initially low and then gradually increased to a stable level after 20 min. When 10-min periods of light and dark were alternated, activity was low in light and high in dark; curiously, activity during alternating dark periods was markedly higher than originally obtained during either extended dark or light. Further experiments explored the variables influencing this alternating pattern of activity. Varying the duration of the initial dark period (10-20 min) did not affect subsequent activity in either light or dark. The activity increase on return to dark was, however, greater following 15 min than 5 min of light. Acute ethanol increased activity at 1 and 2% and severely decreased activity at 4%. One-percent ethanol retarded the transition in activity from dark to light, and the habituation of activity in dark, while 2% ethanol increased activity regardless of lighting condition. Collectively, these results show that locomotion in larval zebrafish can be reliably measured in a 96-well microtiter plate format, and is sensitive to time of day, lighting conditions, and ethanol.

AB  - Certain fundamental questions in the field of developmental biology can only be answered when cells are placed in novel environments or when small groups of cells in a larger context are altered. Watching how one cell interacts with and behaves in a unique environment is essential to characterizing cell functions. Determining how the localized misexpression of a specific protein influences surrounding cells provides insightful information on the roles that protein plays in a variety of developmental processes. Our lab uses the zebrafish model system to uniquely combine genetic approaches with classical transplantation techniques to generate genotypic or phenotypic chimeras. We study neuron-glial cell interactions during the formation of forebrain commissures in zebrafish. This video describes a method that allows our lab to investigate the role of astroglial populations in the diencephalon and the roles of specific guidance cues that influence projecting axons as they cross the midline. Due to their transparency zebrafish embryos are ideal models for this type of ectopic cell placement or localized gene misexpression. Tracking transplanted cells can be accomplished using a vital dye or a transgenic fish line expressing a fluorescent protein. We demonstrate here how to prepare donor embryos with a vital dye tracer for transplantation, as well as how to extract and transplant cells from one gastrula staged embryo to another. We present data showing ectopic GFP+ transgenic cells within the forebrain of zebrafish embryos and characterize the location of these cells with respect to forebrain commissures. In addition, we show laser scanning confocal timelapse microscopy of Alexa 594 labeled cells transplanted into a GFP+ transgenic host embryo. These data provide evidence that gastrula staged transplantation enables the targeted positioning of ectopic cells to address a variety of questions in Developmental Biology. © 2009 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have been widely used to study the molecular mechanisms of development including neurodevelopment. More recently, they have begun to be used to study neuropharmacology and neurotoxicology. Critical for this line of research are methods to study behavioral function in zebrafish. Previous studies have compared zebrafish with mammalian models to determine similarities and differences in locomotor behavior, learning and memory. Relatively little research has been conducted on stress response and anxiety behavior as well as the pharmacologic response in zebrafish. We have developed a test for zebrafish to assess stress response and anxiety: the novel tank diving test. In this short test normally zebrafish dive to the bottom of a novel tank and then gradually over the 5-min test begin exploring higher levels of the tank. Nicotine, which has anxiolytic effects in rodents and humans was found to diminish this novel tank diving response in zebrafish. The current study examined the nicotinic receptor subtype selectivity involved in the actions of nicotine. Two nicotinic receptor subtype selective antagonists were used: MLA (an α7 antagonist) and DHβE (an α4β2 antagonist). We replicated our previous finding of the anxiolytic effect of nicotine with significantly less bottom dwelling by the fish after nicotine treatment. This nicotine-induced anxiolytic effect was reversed by both MLA and DHβE, indicating that both nicotinic α7 and α4β2 receptors are involved in the nicotinic effect on anxiety in zebrafish. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Zebrafish (zebra danio) are becoming increasingly popular in behavioral neuroscience and behavior genetics. This small vertebrate may be utilized in modeling human brain disorders. One of the major neuropsychiatric conditions still not well understood is abnormally increased fear and anxiety. Zebrafish may be an appropriate organism with which these human diseases can be modeled and their biological mechanisms investigated. Predator induced anxiety paradigms have been suggested as useful methods in translational research. Shoaling fish, such as zebrafish, are known to respond to alarm substances with antipredatory or alarm reactions. However, these responses are not well characterized in zebrafish. In the current paper, we investigate the behavioral responses of zebrafish elicited by its alarm substance. Using observation-based as well as video-tracking aided behavior quantification methods we demonstrate significant alarm substance-induced behavioral changes that are independent of the presence of a predatory fish stimulus. The results suggest that, once refined, the use of alarm substance with zebrafish will allow the development of high throughput behavioral paradigms for drug and mutation screening aimed at the analysis of the biological mechanisms of fear in vertebrates. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The optokinetic reflex (OKR) is a basic visual reflex exhibited by most vertebrates and plays an important role in stabilizing the eye relative to the visual scene. However, the OKR requires that an animal detect moving stripes and it is possible that fish that fail to exhibit an OKR may not be completely blind. One zebrafish mutant, the no optokinetic response c (nrc) has no OKR under any light conditions tested and was reported to be completely blind. Previously, we have shown that OFF-ganglion cell activity can be recorded in these mutants. To determine whether mutant fish with no OKR such as the nrc mutant can detect simple light increments and decrements we developed the visual motor behavioral assay (VMR). In this assay, single zebrafish larvae are placed in each well of a 96-well plate allowing the simultaneous monitoring of larvae using an automated video-tracking system. The locomotor responses of each larva to 30 minutes light ON and 30 minutes light OFF were recorded and quantified. WT fish have a brief spike of motor activity upon lights ON, known as the startle response, followed by return to lower-than baseline activity, called a freeze. WT fish also sharply increase their locomotor activity immediately following lights OFF and only gradually (over several minutes) return to baseline locomotor activity. The nrc mutants respond similarly to light OFF as WT fish, but exhibit a slight reduction in their average activity as compared to WT fish. Motor activity in response to light ON in nrc mutants is delayed and sluggish. There is a slow rise time of the nrc mutant response to light ON as compared to WT light ON response. The results indicate that nrc fish are not completely blind. Because teleosts can detect light through non-retinal tissues, we confirmed that the immediate behavioral responses to light-intensity changes require intact eyes by using the chokh (chk) mutants, which completely lack eyes from the earliest stages of development. In our VMR assay, the chk mutants exhibit no startle response to either light ON or OFF, showing that the lateral eyes mediate this behavior. The VMR assay described here complements the well-established OKR assay, which does not test the ability of zebrafish larvae to respond to changes in light intensities. Additionally, the automation of the VMR assay lends itself to high-throughput screening for defects in light-intensity driven visual responses. © JoVE 2006-2011 All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Zebrafish has been a favourite of developmental biologists and numerous genetic tools have been developed for this species. In recent years, zebrafish has become an increasingly popular subject of neuroscientists and behavioural scientists. One of the typical characteristics of zebrafish is shoaling, individuals forming a tight group in which fish swim together. The biological mechanisms of social behaviours are complex and not well understood in vertebrates, and zebrafish, due to its highly social nature and the genetic tools developed for it, may represent an excellent animal model with which these mechanisms may be studied. Improvement of behavioural quantification methods would facilitate research in this area. We describe a custom software application that allows the precise quantification of several parameters of group cohesion in zebrafish. We also present three experimental examples to illuminate the use of our methodology, and show how group cohesion changes in response to manipulations of the environment. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anxiolytic effects of nicotine have been documented in studies with rodents and humans. Understanding the neural basis of nicotine-induced anxiolysis can help both with developing better aids for smoking cessation as well as with the potential development of novel nicotinic ligands for treating anxiety. Complementary non-mammalian models may be useful for determining the molecular bases of nicotine effects on neurobehavioral function. The current project examined whether a zebrafish model of anxiety would be sensitive to nicotine. When zebrafish are placed in a novel environment, they dive to the bottom of the tank. In the wild, diving could help to escape predation. We tested the anxiolytic effect of nicotine on the novelty-elicited diving response and subsequent habituation. Zebrafish placed in a novel tank spent the majority of time at the bottom third of the tank during the first minute of a 5-min session and then show a gradual decrease in time spent at the tank bottom. Nicotine treatment at 100 mg/l for 3 min by immersion before testing caused a significant decrease in diving throughout the session, while 50 mg/l was effective during the first minute when the greatest bottom dwelling was seen in controls. Nicotine effects were reversed by the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine given together with nicotine, but not when administered shortly before the test session after prior nicotine dosing. This implies that the effect of nicotine on diving was due to net stimulation at nicotinic receptors, an effect that is blocked by mecamylamine; and that once invoked, this effect is no longer dependent on continuing activation of nicotinic receptors. The effect of nicotine on diving did not seem to be the result of a general disorientation of the fish. The 100 mg/ml nicotine dose was shown in our earlier study to significantly improve spatial-discrimination learning in zebrafish. Nicotine-induced anxiolytic effects can be modeled in the zebrafish. This preparation will help in the investigation of the molecular bases of this effect. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The regionalization of the neural tube along the anteroposterior axis is established through the action of patterning signals from the endomesoderm including the organizer. These signals set up a pre-pattern which is subsequently refined through local patterning events. The midbrain-hindbrain junction, or isthmus, is endowed with such an organizing activity. It is able to induce graded expression of the Engrailed protein in the adjacent mesencephalon and rhombencephalon, and subsequently elicits the development of tectal and cerebellar structures. Ectopically grafted isthmus was also shown to induce Engrailed expression in diencephalon and otic and pre-otic rhombencephalon. Fgf8 is a signalling protein which is produced by the isthmus and which is able to mimic most isthmic properties. We show here that the isthmus, when transposed to the level of either rhombomere 8 or the spinal cord, loses its ability to induce Engrailed and cerebellar development in adjacent tissues. This is accompanied by the down-regulation of fgf8 expression in the grafted isthmus and by the up-regulation of a marker of the recipient site, Hoxb-4. Moreover, these changes in gene activity in the transplant are followed by a transformation of the fate of the grafted cells which adjust to their novel environment. These results show that the fate of the isthmus is not determined at 10-somite stage and that the molecular loop of isthmic maintenance can be disrupted by exogenous signals.
